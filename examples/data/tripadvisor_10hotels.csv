"A Poor Experience Never To Be Repeated We make a booking through another AC hotel en route from Germany where we stopped for coffee. we were informed cost for two persons with breakfast was 77euros.We arrived at 1400 no room booked, no problem said receptionist there are plenty of rooms here!After a good day in amsterdam we returned tired and hungry, dinner in their restaurant is very poor, when you do get some service you do not get but the minimum of attention. Hence we gave up trying to get the missing items from our order. Poor food, poor service.Very noisy room, very basic room. We lay straight on to a stained mattress no underblanket! HORRID.Breakfast although there were 4 staff in attendance we eventually sat at a dirty table, no-one came to clean it or offer us cutlery, we helped ourselves from behind the counter. Check- out we were charged 111euros for our room? No explanation except we were given a business room which is n ot advised, front on the hotel next to the noise and it is noisy!!! We were on a leisure trip as explained on arrival no rate given or indeed displayed anywhere behind reception. Watch out !Next letter is to the hotel to ask why!A POOR EXPENSIVE EXPERIENCE NOT TO BE REPEATED.  ",1
Not as bad as it's painted We read the reports and thought it cant be as bad as the Admiral Oostend. It did sound that way so we were pleasently suprised to find the hotel clean dispite a major flood the previous week. Some of the rooms had limited service on the TV due to a lighining strike. We were given such a room but with help from the night porter JONN he put us in a room with 90% service on the TV. The system is due to be checked out this week 25.08.08 so check before you go. The rooms were clean but do need to be upgraded as they are now looking a bit careworn The food both breakfast included and dinner bought was fantastic and service very good. The only problem we had was a group of rowdie guests (not sure where they were from not English) who decided they were going to enjoy themselves and to he-- with all the other guests. Unfortunatly the hotel staff did nothing to stop them. One of them was using the flowers from the tables as a microphone and each time one of his companions took one off him he just got another from another table it was funny the first time!  ,2
"Horrible Insight vacation hotel This hotel is horrible for taking luggage to your room. We had to go all the way the end of the hotel to find our room, only to have been given a key that was not working. We had been traveling since 5 am and were exhausted from the pace of Insight vacations. About midnight we heard a commotion outside our window - someone entertaining a giggling lady and at 2:30 am the same couple approached from outside our hotel door giggling and then OPENING our door. I flew out of bed, I had my two teenage daughters with me, and barely slammed the door shut. They had given the key to my room to the guy and his date! I told him we were in the room and he tried AGAIN to open the door, telling me it was his room. Insight Vacations had assigned us this room and our luggage was delivered to the room, When I called the front desk, I was informed that the rooms had been entered in the computer wrong and no one even apologized. I told our tour director from Insight, Raymond and he just laughed and said that was a first for him  ",3
"A bit scungy, on a noisy road, and quite far away from the city centre This was the last stop of our tour and what a disappointment it was. The room was quite scungy. I could feel the springs in my bed. The room we had was right next to the road and was very noisy. The curtains didn't block out any light and the shower was pathetic. Breakfast facilities were ok, but other than that, this hotel was nothing to rave about. It was a long way from the centre of town, and the walk to the nearest train station was about 20 minutes. Not worth it.  ",4
"It's not what it seems (sadly) It's not an hotel for visitang Amsterdam. We already know it and we took it as a base to travel by car. Even then we've been satsified.It's a very long building. You have to take a long walk to go to some rooms. The rooms aren't specially confortable, although they're very big. The receptionists weren't helpful and seemed to not know some basics of the hotels. There was no do not disturb sign in our room and we asked for it. When they got to know what we were asking they said they'd do something about it. We asked again later and they told us they have said to the room service to leave it there, hanging on the door. We told us to not leave it hanging in the door, because we'd be out all the day. Our fears came true at night when we got back. The sign was hanging in the door and the room wasn't cleaned. The room service thought we were in.Don't even think to eat in the brasserie. Or... yes, do it. It was a complete disaster. We decided to eat there because we were tired and we spent 2 hours there, most of the time waiting. Waiting to be asked, waiting the dinner and... no! Not the note! This was fast. Luckily, as it was a complete disasters, they got wrong in most of the things and our dinner ended being 10 euro cheaper as it was supposed to be. Most of the customers there were really angry.The breakfast buffet was correct.We suggest to change the air-freshener.  ",5
"Not bad Stayed here because we were going to a concert at the Amsterdam Arena, which is outside the city, and didn't want to travel back downtown after the show. Room and bathroom were quite large for European standards. Room was very clean. Free parking, which is a huge plus in Amsterdam. It is far from the downtown area but not too difficult to get there as long as you aren't expecting a 5 minute trip. We brought our bikes and biked downtown, which took about an hour each way on some nice paths. The second day, we walked to the metro station (about 10 minutes) and took the metro to Central Station, which took about 30 minutes. Desk staff was helpful with questions. It's not a luxury hotel but if you are looking for something a little outside the city, it's a good choice and a good price for Amsterdam.  ",6
"Good but far away from city Excellent hotel for those who like to stay away from the city in a relax atmosphere!Everything was good, except that you have to take a taxi, if you are hanging out late night in the city!  ",7
"Good for motorists; close to motorway Beware: This hotel is NOT in or near downtown Amsterdam !That being said, I have to state that I have stayed in this hotel a couple of times recently while being on business trips.LOCATION:This 3-storey hotel is conveniently located off the A9-motorway near Gaasperplas and has a big parking lot (though even this one can get quite full at times).About 1 km (0.6 mi) away is the terminus of a Light Rail line which will take you to City Center of Amsterdam.There are no other buildings in the vicinity of the hotel. To visit a restaurant you best have a car available (or get a taxi).ROOMS:... are quite large in size with a roomy bathroom.No real problems with cleanliness sofar. Beds are firm and comfortable.Numerous rooms face the street, but noise is not a problem here.A few rooms have a balcony overlooking a canal.The micro-fridge is always locked and I never cared about it.There is no Wireless-LAN in the rooms and also only the business rooms have a dataport - and this is of the local style only, rather than the usually found outlet for Western-plugs. Trying to find a adaptor for it can be difficult.RESTAURANT:Food in the evening is good (谩 la carte) with the set menu麓s offering the best deals. The restaurant is also frequented by non-hotel guests.Breakfast is a mix of continental and american style with a local touch.Beware: Upon my recent trips, almost every morning there was a tour group of chinese tourists in the hotel: Not every morning the hotel staff was paying attention, that these groups have a seperate area set aside for their breakfast - so it became rather full in the breakfast area.SERVICE:Apart from a single occasion where I got checked-in into a room that appeared to be occupied by a member of hotel staff, I haven`t run into any further problems.As I am a return customer, check-in is accomplished very fast - no more forms to be filled out for me.Upon my last check-out, staff surprised me when they were aware that I would return 3 weeks later ... (another 2 weeks in this hotel for business).COSTS:With a negotiated company rate, this hotel costs only a fraction of the hotels downtown plus parking is free !  ",8
"Not even a 2 star hotel Our recent stay in Amsterdam was totaly ruined by our agent booking us at the Tulip Inn Riverside. The entery and lobby and also the dining areas are all OK but.....just walking down the hall will give you the impression that the rooms can't be much better than the hall. The wallpaper is torn off, the carpet needs to be replaced etc. We were first put into a room on the ground floor that had a patio sliding door but it didn't open. The room smelled as if that door had never been open. We asked to be changed and were put into a room with one twin bed and a window that opened about 4 inches. There is no a/c and it got hot and humid when it rained. When we asked about the bed they said they only have twins and would bring in another bed. Oh well. The cab ride into Amsterdam costs about 30 ureos and the train about 3 each and takes one hour. We asked an employee and were told not an area to go out at night...no matter there is no where to go. You are out in the boonies. One evening when we came home there was a notice on the door that the restraunt would be closed for dinner. It was not there when we left in the morning and thank God we ate in the city. The next night was Sunday and when we went to eat the waiter told us the kitchen was closed....Sunday is buffet night but of course no one told anyone. There were other people who had cars so they went elsewhere but we were sort of stuck there. After talking with the Mgr we did get something to eat but not a very happy waiter/chef at the time. I would suggest paying more getting closer to the city and you'll still probably spend less...transportation will be so much less. The hot breakfast that we got included was actually pretty good. The employees are good except for the Mgr who asked us just what we expected for a 3 star and then we found out it is a 2 star.  ",9
nice hotel for groups If you are a group visiting amsterdam for nightlife it is a clean and friendly hotel.The metro is just a 10 minute walk and coming back by cab it is 20 minutes and about 35 euros.The room is spacious and clean. Beds are good and breakfast is excellent!Employees not always friendly and stressed.I would recommend it.  ,10
"Just Average Was clean  comfortable, location not the best. Dinner was buffet style, totally disorganized with folks acting like it was the last meal on earth.  ",11
"Terrible Location, Acceptable Service The hotel itself is acceptable. However, the location is terrible. It is certainly not located a stones throw away from anything except perhaps sheep (which you can see out the hotel window). The only way to get to the train station is to walk down a deserted street approximately a mile from the hotel with only an RV trailer on one side, and a wooded park on the other side. This walk takes about 20 minutes, and there is NO other option. Buses do not run down this block, and cab companies will not come only to take you to the train station. Once you get to the train station, it is about a 20 minute ride to Centraal Station. This hotel is not at all centrally located to ANYTHING. The hotel service itself is acceptable, and there is a breakfast served in the morning consisting of eggs, breads, and assorted meats and cheeses. The hotel room itself is clean, as are the hotel grounds. I would never stay there again though, since the location is so terrible and so far and unsafe from the train and bus station.  ",12
"Poor location, no air conditioning Stayed one night at this hotel as part of an Insight tour. The hotel is located far away from Amsterdam city centre (taxi fare about 20 Euros each way) and reaching public transportation is not convenient either. The hotel has no air conditioning but there are plenty of mosquitoes since the back of the hotel is essentially farmland (you can see cows from the hotel rooms). Otherwise, fairly standard hotel room.  ",13

Great location but that's all       View from room  ,54
"Perfect location for Berlin long weekend We've just returned from a long weekend in Berlin. The Sofitel was a great choice - fabulous location on Gendarmenmarkt, and within easy walking distance to the Brandenberg Gate, Reichstag, Museum Insel  Alexanderplatz. Two U-bahn stations close by, 5 minutes walk to the Airport bus and a Christmas market right opposite.Our room overlooked an inner courtyard - very quiet. Quality, well appointed room, very comfortable bed  bathroom (although no bath). Breakfast is highly recommended. Staff very polite and helpful. We would definitely go back.Top tips: We booked an official 1 hour tour of the Reichstag  would highly recommend it. Interesting tour  no queues to visit the dome. Also to be recommended is KaDeWe - especially 6th Floor food hall - fabulous!  ",55
"Good Location, Bring your own Soap       bath  ",56
"Fab hotel Great hotel, really good location close to the upmarket shopping district. Had a lovely room overlooking the cathedral. Every luxury you could ask for - Hermes toiletiries in the bathroom, Bose stereo in the bedroom. Wonderful wellness area on the top floor, which has a small sauna and steam room and lovely relaxation areas and showers. A great fitness area as well (not that I used it!). Massages can booked also. Good choice at breakfast. Only downsides - room was very small and the staff were very slightly snooty. Small lobby area - no places to hang around the hotel other than in your room or the wellness area. But these are only minor issues, overall it is a wonderful hotel.  ",57
Best location Stayed in the Sofitel Gendarmenmarkt for 2 nights with my partner in May 08.Lovely hotel situated in former East Berlin on a very green and beautiful square. Couldn't have wished for a better location. Hotel is very funky and modern but the rooms are rather small. Nicely furnished with some cute little twists like a sliding shutter in the bathroom for more privacy and little string you pull on the side of the bed for a lullaby to be played. Also got some chocolates and fruit on arrival which was a nice touch. Didn't have breakfast in the hotel so can't comment on that but the restaurant did look very nice. Went to Solar for dinner one night which had a great view of Berlin. Also a lot of wonderful bars around the hotel so you have plenty do do. I would definately recommend this hotel and i would happily stay there again.  ,58
"Modern and stylish Sofitel in a nice location The location is just fantastic (and probably the reason for the price tag).The rooms are nice, clean and stylish but small. The bed was very comfortable.The only surprise was to find such a small TV and not even plasma/LCD (not that I watched it). The fruits I got as a preferred guest looked in quite bad shape and they went directly into the trash bin. The bathroom (shower only) and its huge doors isn't very practical.There's a small wellness section on the 7th floor with a sauna (not sure it worked properly that day) and a steam bath (very nice). The hot tub was either broken (or not open yet - a saturday at 10am). The view over the roofs is quite nice and so is the small fitness center.I haven't tested any of the restaurants nor breakfast as we spent most of the time in the city and clubbing, and just used the hotel as a place to crash.What I really didn't understand is why they have only one Internet over WiFi provider (with no alternative) who wants to charge 30EUR for 24h! This is unacceptable these days especially as you couldn't use any roaming partner and they seem to filter protocols like VoIP...  ",59
"Fabulous modern hotel Brilliant location Stayed for 3 nights 9-12 December 2007 for sightseeing and xmas markets.It was fantastic.Lucky enough to stay in a deluxe suite which had a seperate sitting area fabulous modern bathroom and really contemporary decor.Fab location overlooking the gendarmenmarkt square which had the biggest and best xmas market, lovely stalls ,eating areas and mulled wine!!!The square also has the opera house and 2 churches which is very picturesque.The area around the hotel is very upmarket and is a stonesthrow away from beautiful shops and shopping malls/department stalls.Brandenburg gate a 10 min walk , Checkpoint Charlie 15 mins away.Also the city-tour bus stops on the square.To the right of the hotel at the end of the street is a beautiful chocolate shop which is an experience not to be missed.Would definately stay here again as its pure luxury.Although breakfast isnt cheap its well worth it so try and get a BB rate if you can.Also no tea/coffee making facilities in room if you like a cuppa when you wake up.  ",60
Wonderful Christmas Break My partner and I stayed in the Sofitel as part of a Birthday weekend.... We had booked a junior suite but upon arrival we were upgraded to a luxury suite...It was amazing.... huge comfortable bed with a lounge area partitioned off with sliding doors... we had one massive bathroom with a bath and one seperate toilet in the lounge area. The bathroom had a plentiful supply of Roger and Gallet toiletries and a cute rubber ducky!!! We had a lovely view of the Gendarmarkt and went to the Christmas Market... I would really recommend going in the evening as the square is beautifully lit up and feels really Christmassy! We drank cocktails in the Newton bar which were delicious and the service is the best I have ever seen!We also went to Watergate nightclub which was fantastic and a great example of how brilliant german clubbing can be!All in all I would definately recommend this hotel and Berlin as a city for a mini break... Especially at Christmas!!!  ,61
"Superb location, friendly staff Culture vultures, gourmets and serial shoppers will delight in the location of this elegant four star hotel, on the edge of the Gendarmenmarkt and in the centre of historic Berlin (but not the best place to stay if your plans focus on the west of the city). Many of the city's world class museums, music and opera venues, art galleries and restaurants are in walking distance, as is the high end shopping of the nearby Friedrichstrasse. Some rooms have a view over the Gendarmenmarkt. We stayed for six nights in a 'junior suite', which was really more a comfortably sized room, well furnished in 'designer' style, apart from a rather ancient TV. The main irritant was an awkwardly designed bathroom and its tiny dysfunctional toilet. The staff are exceptionally friendly and the buffet breakfast must be one of the best in the city (although there are many simpler and less expensive alternatives nearby). There is a well equipped gym and a comfortable 'spa' and the Aigner restuarant is efficient and pleasant. There is no business centre and internet access is expensive and limited. Recommended for a tourist visit, with qualifications on the bathroom. Tip - take your passport with you if you want to rent the excellent audio guides offered in the museums and art galleries.  ",62
"Great location for a weekend break Wonderful location, and just a couple of minutes for the U-Bahn. Rooms small but stylish. OK for short stays, but lack of space would be a problem for longer stays. Also for the price I would have expected a bath as well as a shower.Reception staff friendly and welcoming (I was personally shown to my room by the receptionist, which is unusual these days) but did not seem partiularly well-informed about what's on etc.Breakfast, at EUR 24 is expensive, but great if you like a slow leisurely breakfast with all the trimmings.  ",63
"Sofitel provides trendy elegance Our stay at the Dorint Sofitel Am Gendarmenmarkt in Berlin had a schizophrenic nature. Our first three days we were in a standard room, but for the last two days of our stay, we were upgraded to a suite. What a difference a suite makes! Our first room was elegantly designed, but was a bit small and lacked sufficient storage space. However, we enjoyed its style and the location of this Sofitel is simply superb as the other reviewers mentioned. The Newton Bar, one block away, is fantastic! The major problem of our room, which was on the top floor, was the heat. It was oppressive! Although it was late winter in Berlin, and the wind was howling and the rain pouring, we felt as if we were in Equitorial Africa. I guess heat rises.We mentioned our problem to the management, and voila, next thing you know we are in a suite. Sofitels always come through. The suite was simply magnificent, with two bathrooms, great storage, and a hip ambiance. I must applaud the service at this hotel. I would not hesitate staying at this Sofitel again as long as I am not posted to the highest floor.  ",64
Nice hip hotel - a little overpriced?       The room has a nice view of Gendarmenmarkt  ,65
"Wow what a breakfast! Stayed here for three nights in early February 2007. Quite small, clean room on a high floor with a nice view of the Gendarmenmarkt square. The bathroom was nicely designed but the shower door design was kind of awkward. The room, though very clean, was overheated and I had to open a window to cool the room off. Good central location within walking distance of the Unter den Linden.The bed was very comfortable, with a fluffy, fresh, white duvet. The lighting scheme was very strange, and I found it difficult to read in the room at night. They also need to replace the TVs with flat screens in this price range.The internet setup was awful and I wound up having to buy minutes on the lobby PC, which was really not efficient. Go to an internet cafe instead if you must. The front desk staff were nice enough, but did not know the city very well and were for the most part clueless with regard to tourist type questions.The high point was the AMAZING breakfast buffet, which was included in my winter weekend rate. Wow was it good - the breads were chewy and wonderful, the seafood was plentiful and fresh and I was a happy guy each morning. Lutter and Wegner, which others have mentioned here, was quite good for dinner. There is also a terrific cafe and pastry shop in that direction, as well, steps from the hotel.  ",66
"Excellent Excellent hotel in a great location. The staff is young but very willing. My room, a junior suite, was decent size. Realize that it's a hip hotel, and there is little shelf space and no chest of drawers. This may not be a good choice for an older customer who wants a more formal setting, but it's a great boutique hotel.  ",67
"Superb location This hotel may provide the best breakfast in Berlin but it is over-priced for what any normal person can (or would want to) eat. You are simply paying (over the top) for a choice you do not need or want. Go instead for the more focused breakfast in your room. Having said that, the hotel is otherwise superb - esp. its location, being close to all main sights  Newton's Bar  the best Italian restaurant outside Italy (Maletesta). Steer clear of Lutter  Wegner if the weather is good  the tables outside are busy - the serivce is appallingly slow though the quality of the food may be worth waiting for,  ",68
"Great week at the Sofitel I stayed at the Sofitel for a week during ITB and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I lunched at Aigner, the restaurant on site, and the food was absolutely superb, as was the service, and give the locale, reasonably priced.When I arrived in my room, it was bright, had a small balcony and had a neat design style decoration. The blue spotlight that shines on the bed is`kind of cool, the whole lighting design is pretty neat.Bathroom is nice, all marble and glass and very functional.The breakfast is excellent, and the service is very attentive, and the choices are excellent.There is always drum and bass music playing lightly in in the background in all the public areas.The gym is good, the steam room was fantastic, I did like the selection of different scents you could choose.All in all, great experience.  ",69
"Nice, but a bit boring...... As the Ritz Carlton was fully booked one of the 3 nights in Berlin, we decided to try the Dorint. Well, we actually found ourselves hanging out having a drink and smoking a cigar, at the Cutain Club at the Ritz anyhow :-)The Dorint has a great location, right at the historic Gendarmenmarkt in Old and historic Berlin. Houses may be reconstructed, but the feel is great. Our Favorite spot for meals and great wine (Lutter  Wegner) is just two steps away.The service at the Dorint however is invisible The staff invisible. Not that we did not get the service we needed, but a true great hotel has alway warm and attentive staff placed here and there.Your lucky if you spot any other staff than in the reception. There is no place to hang out, no real lobby to lounge in, or to enjoy a drink. The public spaces at the hotel are simply so boring, that you will fall asleep after five minutes of hanging out in the reception-area or walking around.zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......... boring. The rooms are rather small though very well designed. The design is modern, clever and boring. The TV-set should however be replaced. It was a great laugh.On a positive note,The place is clean and well run. Staff friendly when you actually meet them. THE SPA AND GYM IS MAGNIFICENT. TRULY GREAT! I must say, the spa and gym is one of the best i have ever visited. Really nice. But beware, its mixed and naked. (Just like all other german spas.)The restaurant next door (Aigner) is great. Breakfast at the hotel is rich to say the least , a buffet that beats everything i have seen in any hotel. The room in wich its served is also very cool, but we ended up having breakfast on town anyway, it was simply too boring as we were just a few guests and the atmosphere too sterile.All in all its a OK place to stay in, if you get yourself a good rate. We did, and slept well, in a great location. Nothing else. Eating, drinking, laughing and hving a great time, we did on town and at Lutter  Wegner.  ",70
Great!       Room on 1st floor  ,71
"Superb Room was newly decorated and impecable. Good size, slightly soft bed but otherwise just brilliant. Breakfast was amazing, with as much as you like of almost anything you could imagine. I didn't know so many varieties of bread roll existed! I am sure you could stay somewhere else in berlin that is very nice and much cheaper, but if you want to lavish yourself..........stay here.  ",72
"Perfect Location This is a hotel with a difference, and all good.The basic rooms tend to be small by Berlin standards, however they have everything you will require and a standard of detail that is rarely found.The location could not be better, both for business and pleasure, with a taxi rank opposite the front door.The restaurant is stylish without being over the top, and prices are fair. The perfect place to relax after a day at the office.Staff are courteous and helpful and happy to spend time explaining how to get about the city.Definitely on my list of places to stay.  ",73
"Superb We stayed at the Dorint for 3 nights in August.What a fantastic experience.The hotel is stylish, quiet (even though our room was directly over the entrance) and totally professional.The staff were a delight...so helpful with good dining suggestions and booking help.The room is attractive and well laid out and the bathroom has the best lighting for make-up in any hotel I've ever stayed in.Great closet space.Only question would be the rather shiny surfaced mattress protector used on the bed.Breakfast is expensive....23 Euros, but extremely good and the breakfast staff and really helpful with Berlin tips when you chat to them.The location is fabulous, near the most elegant square in Berlin, and around the corner from one of the best shopping streets in the city.Museums and the Reichstag are all within walking distance.Very highly recommended.Have a meal at Lutter and Wegner, one block away...it's superb.  ",74
"Hidden gem Our family stayed here the end of May, 2006. The staff was very friendly and eager to help us in any way. The rooms were a good size, spotless, and they were able to give us the adjoining rooms we requested. The rooms were very modern and the beds were very comfortable. This hotel is on a quiet street but centrally located. It was an easy walk to Check Point Charlies and the Brandenberg Gates and only a block to the U-Bahn. Several nice restaurants in the area. An engergy efficient system requires your room key to be inserted in a slot inside the door for turning on the lights and when you leave and take your key, the lights automatically turn off in a few minutes. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Berlin.  ",75
"Absolutely Fantastic Hotel in Heart of Berlin's Mitte We stayed here for 5 nights in mid-May and could not say enough fantastic things about this hotel. We had a deluxe room on the top floor [6th floor] with a breathtaking view of the French Cathedral right out our window! The room was spacious, even by American standards. The staff was great! They were more than eager to help with any questions/requests that we had.The hotel is located within walking distance to almost every major site in Berlin and multiple U-Bahn and S-bahn stations within a moments walk. The Gendarmenmarkt is beautiful and a quiet corner of an otherwise busy city.I would not even consider staying at another hotel in Berlin.  ",76
"Absolutely Wonderful No question, this is a major hotel find in Berlin. Pay for a Deluxe room that includes the best breakfast buffet we saw in our three weeks in Europe, and you are tempted to spend your entire vacation in Berlin. We stayed five nights and walked to all the important sites. Many fine dinner options all within an easy walk from the hotel. Also concerts, opera, and ballet are close by. Fabulous staff, management, atmosphere, and accomodations...very hard to beat!  ",77

"Great Location, great accomodation, great value Great location, this is the overflow to the pricier Dai-Ichi. It therefore does not have restaurants etc but is more like an apartment block. This does not matter though as there are hundreds of restaurants within walking distance. This is one of the best located hotels for Ginza and its surrounding areas.Great value  ",92
"Loved the Dai-Ichi Hotel The room is in a very good order, and the deco is good. Flat screen TV, and a personal computer with free Internet connection are available in the room. The staff speaks very good English and is always very helpful. But you will have to go to the main Dai-Ichi Hotel (2 minutes walk away) if you need to use the facilities in the business centre.The location of the hotel is very good - only takes 5 minutes to walk to the main Ginza shopping area. The nearest metro station is Shimbashi (on Ginza and Asakusa Lines), and it is just a few minutes walk from the hotel (take Exit 7 for the hotel). The Italian restaurant at the hotel is not so good - but there are many nice reastaurants in the surrounding area so plenty of choices are available for dinning. The number of TV channels are limited, but BCC is available in English indeed. You just have to press the sound button on the remote control a few times to set the language into English.  ",93
"Okay but... Rooms were small (even double booked for 1 person), but clean and adequately furnished and the morning English language paper was nice BUT ALL TV (EVEN CNN AND BBC) was presented in Japanese.The location was extremely convenient.  ",94
"Absolute Recommended We stayed in this hotel for 3 days - it was a very good experience. The staff is extremely helpful and polite - somebody from the reception helped us to book the hotel for our trip next location. Even if there are some train tracks on the other side of the road, the rooms are pretty well isolated and this was not an issue. The subway station is close, so it's an area with restaurants. The room is clean with a decent size and has free Internet access(we borowed an Internet cable from the reception), fridge, TV, hair dryer, flat screen TV.  ",95
"Good location, nice hotel This was our second stay here at the Annex. They have done some of the rooms up since last year (we were on the 7th floor and it was definitely new). The location is brilliant - if you have a JR pass especially so - you are across the street from Shimbashi station and you can use the Yamanote line for free inside tokyo with your pass to get pretty much everywhere you need to go (Akihabara, Shinjuku, Shibuya, etc).There are loads of small restaurants within 2 - 5 minutes walking and of course you have all that Ginza has to offer shopping wise.Bic Camera is right down the street too. What's not to love?They have a new underground passage to Shimbashi station, which is nice if it is raining. There is also a new German (?!?!) restaurant located downstairs next door if you need a quick beer and a bratwurst! We've never managed to make it to the Italian restaurant on the premises - the hours are not good - but there is plenty of great stuff on offer all around.The only downside is not specific to the Annex - the lack of ability to control the room temperature. The japanese like their rooms HOT!We'll be back on our next trip in September, so I think that says it all.  ",96
"Comfortable and convenient We enjoyed our three day stay here as it was very comfortable , clean and the staff were extremely helpful. The hotel is in a convenient location within about 7 minutes walk from the metro. If you are on a budget this is an ideal place to be. [Going to the loo in your hotel room is certainly an interesting experience, I laughed like a drain every time I went! Some loos will even play you a tune.] Tokyo is a mixture of ugly futuristic buildings and beautiful historic shrines. It is an interesting place, but I would not want a second visit. Unless you are wealthy, don't eat in the restaurants they are VERY expensive. It is possible to find little back street 'noodle houses' and eat for about 拢12 each.  ",97
"Highly recommended This hotel is excellent in terms of value for the money. I had a recently refurbished room on 9th floor. The room was on the small side but absolutely adequate, the most clean one we had in Japan and nothing to complain about. There is enough space for the luggage of two persons. The bed was very comfortable and I loved the pillows -one memory foam and the other feather. We could never hear any noise from other rooms during the 7-day stay. And the massage chair was extra bonus. The best thing was definitely the wonderful view you can enjoy sitting on the large window sill.  ",98
"Great Value The annex is typically the lesser of the main hotel, and while we didn't stay in the main hotel, it was worth the savings. The hotels are coordinated, so they work together. We used the business centre at the main, and their porters whisked between the buildings, etc. The tour desk/concierege was excellent at the Annex. The rooms are a reasonable size for Japan, complete with mini fridge, drawers, LARGE desk, and flat screen tv. Each bedside table was reasonably sized with a drawer and shelf. Electric drapes were useful too. The bed, pillows and linens were very comfortable, and well-appointed room. It was quiet, and we really enjoyed the stay for the value. It is not ultra-lux, but very luxurious for its star rating. We took a taxi from Toyko Station, as the transfer to Shimbashi and Ginza would have been tiring. It's well located to high-end Ginza, and very close (underground connected) to the metro station. It was a perfect base for our three nights in Tokyo. This was a great stay, and I would recommend this annex to anyone. We also took the airport limo from the hotel, which then gave us a very late checkout for free (highly recommended).  ",99
"High marks for the Dai Ichi Annex I stayed at the Dai Ichi Annex from Dec 22-29. I had a very favorable experience. My room was on the 7th floor. The hallway was spotless as was my room. The bed was very firm, and the room was quite small but immaculate. I rarely heard any noise from other rooms or the hallway in seven days. The front desk staff were friendly and attentive, and most spoke sufficient English to get my questions answered. HUGE PLUS - I brought my Mac Book with wifi access - they gave me a cord and I had FREE Internet access in my room the entire trip. That's a first for me. Great location near several subway stops, shopping, cafes - plus I walked to the Fish Market - an absolute must see.When I got my bill I was expecting some add-ons that typically appear on hotel bills - and there were none (of course I didn't use the exhorbitant mini-bar). I didn't eat at the restaurant - I was on a tight budget. The bus to and from the airport was great - 3000 Yen each way, dropping me off at the Dai Ichi just across the street. 60-90 minutes each way.I'd return to the Dai Ichi Annex in a heart beat.  ",100
Great place to stay Well situated in the business district within walking distance of Ginza and the Imperial Palace and close to a subway station for reaching any part of Tokyo. Very comfortable and modern with a nice restaurant as well as being very close to other eating places. Staff could not have been more helpful and a particular benefit is that the main hotel is a stop on the route of the Airport Limousine service so transit to and from the airport is entirely hassle free as well as cheap.  ,101
"Loved the Dai-Ichi Hotel Annex Exceptional value and very good overall experience. Very helpful, English-speaking staff (a non-trivial find in Tokyo hotels), quite comfortable beds, and an extremely convenient, central location adjacent to a major train stop (Shinbashi) and within walking distance to many interesting areas (Maronouchi, Ginza, Akihabura, Shiodome, Tsukiji ec). I noticed a few stains on the carpets, and the dated decor--but what did I care, I only went home to rest, and the bed was comfortable enough that I was actually able to sleep--unlike other Tokyo hotels I've stayed at where the miserable, rock-hard beds were not conducive to resting.This would be my top hotel choice for a return trip to Tokyo.  ",102
"Tokyo Favorite I lived in Tokyo for 10 years, and now come back on business every quarter. Although my firm's offices are near the hotel, I would stay here even on non-business trips. The hotel is very clean, staff is very professional and helpful, and the location is just ideal: near Ginza, the palace and many transportation options. Best of all is the price: to get a place of this quality in New York would cost 3 times as much. I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Tokyo on a budget. Some business travelers may prefer a hotel with more dining options, but the area is full of great restaurants.  ",103
"Expectations exceeded We stayed 3 nights at this location. I was worried that the quality had gone downhill based on reviews from different websites. We were pleased with the choice and would be likely to return, esp. at a rate of $125 per night in Tokyo!Great location with easy access to Shimbashi station and several other stations, convenient for sightseeing. Right across the street from all of the great little yakitori restaurants and other places tucked under the Yamanote train line. I prefer this location over others in Tokyo because there's good access to lots of late night places and lots of sightseeing opportunities (often using the train or subway), but not nearly as busy as some areas of Tokyo. Also, several coffee shops within shouting distance of the hotel where you can get a morning set of coffee and some sort of breakfast sandwich, pastry, etc. We did not use the hotel restaurant or the sister hotel's restaurants (sister hotel is the more expensive Dai-Ichi Hotel, located right next door).Fantastic front desk staff with good English and very helpful in finding various locations, etc. The room was of adequate size. I've certainly stayed in smaller rooms througout Japan. We had access to CNN/BBC and they gave us an English language paper in the am.Found the room to be clean and not smokey. The hotel is looking a bit worn in some areas, but they were undergoing a renovation while we were there. A few floors at a time. We were in no way inconvenienced by this and probably wouldn't have known it was occurring had it not been for the signs and then the delivery men bringing in new mattresses one day.The mattresses: hopefully the new mattresses are an improvement? A little saggy and not the most supportive, but I like a really good mattress and so try not to be too judgemental on this point when staying at a hotel. Just pointing it out for others. We'd be very likely to return to this location (esp. with those rates!) in the future.  ",104
"Great Hotel: Clean, Modern, and Convienent This was a great hotel. Its located minutes from Ginza 2 blocks away from the train station. If you are looking for a hotel with banquet rooms, botiques and bars, this is not for you. If you are looking for a convienent location, modern clean room, and great staff, you have found the place. They are currently in the process of renovating the hotel and we stayed on one of the renovated floors. The rooms were very modern, nicely decorated, with large flat screen televisions and a large desk. There were both japanese and western robes for the guests. We stayed at other hotels rated higher from this website, but enjoyed this hotel much more. We will stay there again.  ",105
"Not Clean nor Non-Smoking We had reserved a room here after a family member had stayed here 2 years ago. He had recommended the room. Well, the years seemed to have taken quite a toll on this hotel. The halls were dingy, and rather worn. The rooms were marked up, especially the walls, by black luggage.We had requested a non smoking room. Unfortunately, the non-smoking was a serious issue for me. They do NOT have non smoking rooms. They simply remove the ashtrays and spray some air freshener. If you are sensitive or have allergies, you have a few options. I resorted to using those face masks sold in drug stores, to filter the smell of smoke.Also, our first room was not clean, and what appeared to be a bloody handprint was on the wall. When we went back to the front desk and complained that we had specified a non-smoking room, we overheard the manager saying oh no! it still smells! They ended up giving us a less smelly room, but just barely. The location is ok, but you will miss out on the more interesting neighborhoods. If you're looking to get a slice of 'normal Japanese' life you will need to take the nearby subway. This is a very sterile area at night, mostly filled with businessmen and civil servants out on an expense account.  ",106
"Good Location In May of 2005, we stayed here for two nights so we could see Ginza, Tsukiji Fish Market, Tokyo Tower, Zofoji Temple, and we got out to Obaida - all great fun and interesting. The non-smoking room and bathroom were good sized, clean, and comfortable and included a tea service. (We had gotten a discounted room that was very reasonable for Tokyo!) We had no trouble with check-in or out and stored our luggage for the day, the day we left. I use a small power wheelchair and had no problem at this hotel. The staff was very nice and helped as they could. One gentlemen took our picture for us. The trains are across the street, but we never heard them. We were able to eat at various places along the way...it was an easy walk to Starbucks for breakfast and we ate Japanese foods the rest of the day.  ",107
"Terrific location Our stay at the Dai-Ichi Annex is very comparable to what other reviewers have said. It's in a terrific location for shopping, restaurants, and public transportaion access. The staff is very very helpful. The facility itself is in need of a make-over. Everything about the place is a bit worn down and a little sad, but clean. We were disappointed with the hotel restaurant. However there are so many terrific area restaurants that are worth exploring, so don't waste your time at the hotel.  ",108
"Great Ginza Located Hotel at a Reasonable Price The other reviews correctly described this property that it needs a slight refurbishing. Our rooms were very clean though, I noticed some slight wallpaper peeling in high traffic areas but no where else. The rooms were quite small, similar to European or HongKong hotel rooms (about 2/3 the size of normal US rooms), definitely no place for more than 1 queen bed. Service was great, good english speaking staff, and they were always there to help.Getting in from Narita was also a breeze, just took the Airport Limosine Bus that goes to the Dai-Ichi Hotel which is just next door, we essentially just crossed a narrow street to get to the Annex.The location of this place is great if you want to stay in the Ginza area. It is about 2 short blocks away from the Shinbashi train station which is serviced by several subway and JR rail lines. It is also about 10 minutes walk to the Ginza shopping area.We did not try their restaurant (nor the ones at the main hotel) as we wanted to save money. Hotel restaurants we found typically charged about 3-5 times what you can get someplace else.When we booked our return airport shuttle with the front desk, they also automatically extended our checkout time (about 3 hours) at no cost, so that I can stay and use the rooms until it was time for us to leave. Also our baggage was checked and transported by the bell man across the street to the main Dai-Ichi hotel, and automatically loaded to our bus.We also found that typically the Japanese refused to accept any tips, I was told that some people actually get insulted by giving them tips, so we refrained from doing so.Overall it was a great 4 night stay at a better than average hotel at very reasonable rates and I can recommend it to anyone.  ",109
"Fantastic Value and Excellent Service I stayed in the Dai Ichi Annex as a tourist for 9 nights in April 06. For the price, I found this hotel to be an absolute gem, being far better value than hotels in New York, London, Paris etc.It鈥檚 true that some of the paintwork and furnishings in the lobby could do with updating but the location is fantastic and the staff are a real asset. Shimbashi Station is a couple of blocks away which provides underground access to the whole city. There are plenty of cheap eats and more expensive restaurants within walking distance and mini markets 7/11 and Lawsons can supply snacks drinks etc. The hustle, bustle and bright lights of Ginza are just around the corner as is the relatively tranquil Hibiya ParkThe English speaking concierge can offer advice for the tourist and will book any sightseeing excursions on your behalf, she also keeps an impressive stock of leaflets, timetables etc and even printed out a weather forecast in English for us.The room was adequately sized and extremely clean, fresh towels, kimono and European style robes were supplied daily. A couple more English TV channels would have been nice, but the electronic curtains and toilet made up for that. The mini bar was quite expensive but well stocked.As a tourist on a budget I found the Dai Ichi Annex provided a quality of service that far exceeded my expectations.  ",110
"Annex is Both Good and Bad Our experience at the Dai Ichi Annex was both good and bad. (First the bad). When we made our reservation, I specifically stated that I wanted a non-smoking room, and when we checked in, I again verified that we were, in fact, getting a non-smoking room. We went up to our room, opened the door and just about choked from the smell of cigarette smoke. They said they couldn鈥檛 give us another room because they were all booked up, so we just had to grin and bear it. On the good side, the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Once, I went down to the lobby and asked someone if she knew what train I should take to get to Yokahoma. She went behind the main desk for about five minutes and came back with maps, brochures, and various guides. She even gave me advice about what to see and what not to see鈥?I really appreciated that鈥?This mix of good and bad seemed to characterize my whole experience at the Annex. You have free internet access if you have your own computer. Great. If not, you have to go next door to the main hotel and pay 1010 yen per hour. Your room comes with free cable. Great. But you only have two channels in English. (And you have to pay for movie channels.) The Dai Ichi isn鈥檛 a bad hotel. In spite of everything, our time there was fairly pleasant. Yes, the interior is a bit old and worn out, but if the point of your stay is to see Tokyo, you won鈥檛 be spending much time in your room, anyway. If you鈥檙e on a tight budget and just need a place to lay your head at night, you鈥檒l be more than happy here. But if you expect a lot from your hotel, you might be happier some place else.  ",111
"Excellent Value! This hotel is the best buy in Tokyo! You are definitely getting a huge return for your money here! Tokyo is extremely expensive no matter what, but this hotel gives you a decent-sized (for Tokyo, anyway), comfortable room, nice amenities, and OUTSTANDING service! Definitely stay here if you are on a budget but still want a decent hotel. Room was spotless. Bathroom was so clean you could have eaten off the floor (seriously). Free bathrobes AND cotton kimonos/slippers, refreshed daily. Very nice toiletries. Excellent, English-speaking concierge, lots of English-language stations on TV. Great location close to Shimbashi Station and Ginza. Shuttle bus service to Narita Airport, booked for us by concierge. Would definitely stay again!  ",112
"Great Choice for Tokyo Our first trip to Japan -- our first visit to Tokyo. Booked a week in the Dai Ichi based on recommendations from TripAdvisor reviewers. We were really pleased. As other reviewers have mentioned, the location is great for local services and access to transportation for seeing the town. The Urban Dining supermarket under the JR Shimbashi station is just a couple of blocks away; kept us in gourmet snacks at reasonable prices. Dai Ichi Annex is an easy walk to the legendary Ginza shopping streets and to the equally legendary Tsukiji Wholesale Fish Market. Staff at Dai Ichi is very helpful; our first room had a hitch in the free internet access Dai Ichi is rolling out at the annex, they moved into a room with ethernet we could use with our own computer at no charge. Rooms have been discussed here, average size for a large city hotel, and very well equipped and maintained. Dai Ichi has an airport bus service. We'd definitely stay here again.BTW, don't miss the Tokyo Food Page website and Tokyo Metropolitan online for restaurant and entertainment tips. Really enhanced our first trip to Tokyo.  ",113
"Pleasant Stay at Dai Ichi Annex We stayed at the Dai Ichi Annex for 3 days and had a pretty pleasant time there. First of all, it is so convenient to get to/from the airport because the Limo bus just drops you off right next door at the parent Dai Ichi hotel which is only a few steps away. The hotel itself was very clean and did the job. It's a basic hotel room, which was a little small but that's expected in Asian countries. We didn't expect anything ritzy and we got just that.The location is the best as its so close to the subway station (Shimbashi) and it's conveniently located within the Ginza area. So there's plenty of shopping and food places nearby. There is also a great Japanese supermarket right by the train station.For the price and location of this place, we recommend the Dai Ichi Annex!  ",114
"great location, more than adequate As virgin travelers to the Far East, the Dai Ichi Annex was our 1st port of call in a hectic 7 days. Jet lagged and weary, we checked in very pleasantly and were shown to our room, which we found somewhat small and were able to change it promptly and courteously to another room which we were told was 30 sq ft bigger. It did feel airier, and made our 2 night stay much more pleasant.Compared to some of the mega 5 star hotels we were to stay in in other cities as we headed south through Japan, the Dai Ichi Annex was quite basic, but it doesn't claim to be anything more than that.It was quite clean (sheets, towels, bathrooms etc) although the actual bedroom was a little gruppy (stains on the carpet, tears on the wallpaper etc). However, it has a wonderful central location, has a great proximity to train and subway stations, was inexpensive, and has a polite, couteous staff.As a good value, competent starting point, whilst you are getting acclimatised to Tokyo and Japan, I would highly recommend it.  ",115
"Great location and service but This hotel is in a stellar location right near the main shopping and restaurant areas of the Ginza. The service was wonderful but the rooms just weren't good at all - too small with a double bed that had a mattress of concrete. We stayed there our last night in Japan after a 10 day trip. I'm glad it was only for one night. When we were planning the trip, I was actually deciding between this one and the New Otani for the first four days. Fortunately I went with the New Otani. Would not go back to this one after staying at places like the New Otani and Hotel Granvia in Kyoto. Too many other great hotels to choose from.  ",116
"in the center of it all... The main attraction to this hotel is location/ price... you are next to three of the main subway lines in Tokyo and can walk to many great restaurants and attractions. The hotel room was good for the location and filled with gadgets- such as the operable shade opening device- no need to get out of bed in the morning!The staff was friendly, it would be great if they learned a little more english though...  ",117
Mixed Thoughts As already noted - good location to transport and Ginza plus other sites. After 3 nights the small room and bathroom were a bit restricting especially since storage not good. Staff spoke adequate English and were without fault when asked for advice and for extra items. OK for a quick stopver but would go for somewhere a little larger next time - even the Ryokans we stayed in had more room!  ,118
"Small room, lumpy bed I stayed at Dai Ichi Hotel Annex for 4 nites in Sept 2005. I booked a standard room thru Expedia for a reasonable price. There is very little drawer space to hold your clothes  the room is small compared to other hotels. The light bulb over the bed was out when I checked in  I waited to see if Housekeeping would ever change it or notice it  it never got changed. The bed  pillow were very lumpy, which resulted in sleepless nights. Note that the hotel was charging $21US (which is outrageous!) to use the nearby pool, located in another building next door. The front desk's English capability was so-so. I did take the limousine bus to the airport upon leaving, which was convenient. about US30.  ",119
"The True Skinny on the Omni We paid $129 base rate here compared to $168 at the New Otani. The extra money gave us superb service at the Otani vs. the run-down, ugly rooms at the Annex.While the staff is very pleasant, their English is very basic. The rooms are a shadow of their former selves - decades old style and worn out. While clean, the room is extremely basic. Spend the extra money to really enjoy your vacation and stay at a top hotel. This one is merely a place to stay and will in no way enhance your vacation experience.The location is, admittedly, convenient to hundreds of neat Mom  Pop restaurants, 20 minute walk to the fish market and Ginza shopping.  ",120
"Dai Ichi Hotel Annex Stayed there in August, 2005. Very convenient hotel (location, transportation, etc.). Staff was very courteous and friendly. Hotel looks good from the outside, but needs some renovation. Carpets looked old and/or worn out, as did the couches in the lobby. I was a little bit disappointed, but overall a good value.  ",121
"Lovely location, big rooms for Japan We stayed three nights here, and we were delighted. The location is great, and we got from Narita by limousine bus. The railtracks are fascinating - a huge mix of restaurants, bars and shops, with a range of prices, and lively atmosphere. The rooms in the hotel are big by Japan standards, and very well stocked. All of the staff had functional English, some of the staff had perfect English, and they were super-efficient and helpful. If you like jogging, they even had a fold-out map, and the Imperial Park and Hibiya park are both on the doorstep. After being stampeded by thousands of joggers on a fun run (in the opposite direction!) I stuck to circuits of Hibiya Park, which is lovely. Ginza is close by, and we walked everywhere. There are some great noodle bars, and coffee bars and a handy corner shop. Meals were somewhat expensive at the hotel, but there were lots of reasonable places to eat in the area. In fact, what struck us most of all was how reasonably priced Japan turned out to be - one of the bonuses of zero inflation. We loved this hotel, and slept very well. We had great views, and will definitely return to this lovely area.  ",122
"This Hotel Made the Trip to Tokyo so Much Easier..... This hotel was centrally located to the train and the exclusive Ginza area which was very convenient. The help in the hotel is superb. The cleaning services were great and very consistant. The conceirge was extremely helpful in helping guide our way to eveything we wanted to see and visit in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Hakone. Theyll make the reservations and have the bus waiting for you in the morning! It was great! They even electronically have the elevator door opened for you once you walk in the lobby! Also, the checkout time is very flexible considering the time that they schedule your bus pick-up. Very considerate! Overall, this place is great, especially for the rates it offers. To use the internet in the business center was only $5 per 30 minutes and phone calls to the US were approx 40 cents per min. Also, the mini bar wasnt too expensive soda can for less than $2.50. Highly recommended. The best home away from home I've stayed in.  ",123
"A Great Value! We spent 4 nights at the Dai-Ichi Annex Hotel in August. We caught the JR Narita Express train into Tokyo station, about an hour's trip, then waited on the same platform for a few minutes, catching the next train to the Shimbashi Station. The hotel is a five minute walk from there. In fact, if you come out of the station near the big steam engine train in the front of the station, just look up at the skyline and you'll see the Dai-Ichi Hotel. The annex is across the street from it.From the second we walked through the doors, we were served with care and courtesy. The bell girl immediately took our bags and took them to our room on the 9th floor. Check-in was easy (we had booked through Expedia) and, though small, the room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. We never heard a sound from another room or even from the hallway. The bed was very comfortable, more so than most hotels we've stayed in. When we called housekeeping for an iron, it was brought to our room right away. I will say again the room was small by American standards, but I expected that it would be. We requested a room next to ours for our daughter and son-in-law, and they happily accommodated us.It is aslo centrally located, near major train stations and great restaurants. The breakfast buffet is expensive, but there is a McDonalds 2 blocks away, and a Tully's coffee one block away if you prefer to not spend $25 for breakfast.I will stay there again. A great value.

"Perfect Stay We stayed for one night at the Imperial Hotel during a quick trip to Tokyo at the end of a business trip elsewhere in Asia. The service was superb and the staff uniformly helpful in helping us make the most of our brief time in Tokyo. The location was perfect for sightseeing. The room was extremely comfortable. We hope to return for a longer stay in Tokyo, and will definitely return to the Imperial Hotel.  ",149
"Majestic! Stayed here for 2 nights last Dec. 22, '08. We were given a room at the 32nd floor of the Imperial Tower with the view of Ginza. The service is impeccable and the location is the best for us who want to be close to Ginza and train station which are few minutes walk from the hotel.  ",150

"Imperial it is The Imperial Hotel was selected for me by my colleagues in Japan, because it was within walking distance of their offices. I was completely impressed with the hotel in every respect. The service was consistently excellent. I read in my guide book not to tip people, but I tried anyway, and the bellman absolutely refused. As an aside, the hotel is very sensitive to the needs of a novice like myself. The bellman always asked me where I was going, and told the cab driver in Japanese for me. That was immensely helpful. My room was on the tenth floor. It was large, modern and comfortable. The bathroom was particularly nice, with a shower with excellent water pressure, and a modern tub with jets. The toilet had a heated seat and bidet, the soaps smelled lovely, and the hairdryer was strong and hot. The room is equipped with sensors that detect your presence, and light up when you approach (for example, a panel next to the bed that controls opening the curtains, the sound in the room, etc.). My PDA was not working in Japan, so I could not use my phone or email. The hotel phone charges were very modest, and the business center has free internet access. They actually opened early for me one day (usually opens at 8). I ordered room service for breakfast, and it was prompt and very good. On my departure day, I went down to the cafe (which opens at 6am) and asked if I could possibly have a quick breakfast in 15 minutes. I had my food within 3 minutes, and had time to spare! Every person I encountered was professional, friendly and fluent in English. My feable attempts at Japanese were warmly acknowledged. I will absolutely stay here again the next time I am in Tokyo.  ",152
"What a great hotel! What a fabulous hotel! Well, once you visit Tokyo you understand what hospitality and sevice really means!Everything in the Hotel was so clean, the service was excellent with everybody saying Arigato which means thank you! in the hallways, in the elevators, the people took a bow and lookes really helpful. The info desk and the luggage guys were really helpful!Also, my room had a perfect view and in May, tokyo is in its cherry blossom period! Ok, it doesn;t have the Hyatt view, but it keeps the tradition and the class!  ",153
"Imperial Service Long Gone I have stayed at the Imperial for over 15 years and it still manages to add something special to every visit. Yes there are flashier hotels in Tokyo now (Peninsula, RItz Carlton, Hyatt), but only the Imperial has this tradition and only the Imperial remembers to pay attention to detail that the others forget. Perhaps its the whiteness of the laundered shirts or the fresh fruit and flowers in the rooms or perhaps its the clatter of people from all levels of Tokyo society who mingle in the vast lobby adorned by a truly spectaluar feature wall. I can never really place my finger on what makes me come back to the Imperial time and time again .. and I think that's it - it is the service you never see but know is there - gently making your stay in Tokyo - perfect. The Imperial's reign is in no way diminished and she shall rule for many decades to come ...  ",154
"Nice Enough This was our second stay at The Imperial Hotel due to business meetings and our overall hotel stay was pleasant. The Imperial definitely caters to the business traveler in light of its location and meeting space options. The staff is friendly and efficient.We stayed in a standard king size room located on the 31st floor in the Tower Annex and although the decor and furnishings were a bit dated and reflected wear and tear (i.e., worn carpet, worn and stained upholstery, scuff marks on furniture), everything was comfortable and clean. Being a business oriented hotel, we were surprised that the internet access was a bit spotty. We had a view of the train tracks and Hibiya Park. We did hear train noise even being on the 31st floor. The bathroom was large and the shower had great water pressure.Room service breakfast and coffee were fine and delivered promptly by friendly staff. I dined at the hotel's diner style restaurant (for lunch) as well as its tempura restaurant (for dinner) and the food and service were fine.The workout room is ok with some treadmills, a couple of stationary bikes, one elliptical, and three Cybex machines. All of the equipment was acceptable albeit not the most current models. Be sure to join the hotel's complimentary Imperial Club to access the gym at no fee and receive discounts on the hotel's restaurants.A minor concern was that the Concierge team was not overly welcoming and even appeared a bit unenthusiastic. When asked for recommendations and tips for some sightseeing, the concierge rushed through a few options, their access, and all with a dismissive attitude.Overall the Imperial Hotel provided a pleasant stay and their location is convenient to many areas, including the Ginza district. It's a very large, almost generic style of hotel, and understandably cannot provide personalized service. As far as stellar rooms, amenities, and staff, the hotel was fine but the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo is of much higher caliber in every respect.  ",155

"Pleasant experience - recommend it! The hotel is centrally located and very convenient to the metro. The physical building is older, but it is impeccably maintained. The room was spacious and we had a nice view. This is a very pleasant hotel. The staff is professional and friendly. I would recommend staying with them.  ",157
"one of the best hotels This is a great hotel in every way. The staff are friendly, most helpful and speak fluent english. Rooms are immaculate and well furnished. Hotel is convenient to Ginza and other areas of Tokyo. We had a great experience.  ",158
"Outstanding service! The service is the key that differentiates this hotel from others who are in the same price range. I have to admit that I am a complain and picky type of person. I have also been spoiled by living in Thailand where the service is always very good. The Imperial has impressed me big time with the attentive service.The room was nice and correct. It is not very big but has enough space for two to stay in comfortably. Bed was comfortable, features pillows and duvet. We were in a room that has been redecorated. So the room was new and not dated as in some reviews. They also had free internet (but not wireless). The shower was nice with seperate bath and shower and lots of amenities (but no body lotion - although I am sure if you ask, they can provide). The gym had good machines i.e. treadmill, cross-trainers etc. The in-door pool was nice and warm. I also liked their shower room at the gym.... the Japanese style shower area was nice. The hotel is located in good location with Hibiya tube station in front and 5 mins walk to Ginza area. There are also lots of restaurants around. So we did not try any restaurants in the hotel. They looked popular among the Japanese though.The only problem we had was that the staff didn't understand English very well. I called them to ask for some cotton pads but had to explained for a while. At the end, they sent some Shisedo moisturizer to my room (which was nice!). The day after, someone must have told them what 'cotton pad' was. So the maid put lots of them in my room and kept refiling them everyday (and also refilled the Shisedo!). All their staff was very attentive and extremely polite. So the English problem became minor and we were patient enough to repeat our sentences few times until they understood.In short, I really like this hotel and will definitely go back!  ",159
"White gloved efficiency I stayed here on a business trip to Japan. The overwhelming impression on arrival was of the number of staff who seem to have nothing better to do than to hold doors open and bow to guests. Even the cleaners stopped whatever they were doing to bow and greet me every time I walked past.Reception was extremely smooth and efficient despite the fact that we arrived at about 10.00a.m. and we were soon given a room.The rooms are extremely well equipped, and comfortable, the rooms in the main part of the hotel being larger and better equipped than those in the tower. My room looked out over a busy railway line, and despite being on the 21st floor I could hear some noise from the railway. The rooms were reasonably priced for the class of hotel.The hotel has a great many restaurants, some serving Japanese food, while others offered international cuisine of a very high standard. However, the prices in the restaurants seemed high. Breakfast in the parkside diner was always very well prepared with prompt, efficient service. However, I found it slightly odd to be given broccoli with my bacon and eggs. The hotel is well situated within easy walking distance of the Ginza shopping area.Overall it was difficult to fault the hotel.  ",160
"Truly high standard! First impression, visually, is a bit 1970's as you arrive and walk in, but instantly the highly efficient Imperial machine takes over, and you're in for a treat. Service is outstandingly high, delivered by extremely well-trained, helpful and courteous staff, without fail.Everything works, everything is clean, and it's perfectly located for either a walk or run in the park, for Ginza, or for Tokyo station.Join the (free) Imperial Club if you plan to stay more than once - the immediate benefits inlcude food discounts, free gym access, and half-price laundry. Take breakfast at the 17th floor restaurant - it's a fantastic buffet; dining in the hotel is generally expensive, but the Diner on the ground floor provides great value, and is actually fine to sit quietly and chill out after a hectic day's work or sightseeing, either on the 'Fixed price' dinner menu or an international carte. It's usually about half the price or less, of the other restaurants in the hotel.Rooms are top notch, slightly austere in appearance, but functionally excellent - try to get a park view or you'll be overlooking the railway, which is pretty busy.What could be better? More choice of TV channel would be good, and maybe a CD player in the room, but apart from that, go and enjoy.  ",161
"royal past but needs updating This is the third or fourth time I've stayed here because my company gets a discount. It is located conveniently near the Imperial Palace, businesses, and subway lines. The Imperial has an illustrious history, but now it feels dated and worn. Everything looks a little old. I can't comment on the service because I didn't request any, but my colleagues have said it is good.One fun part of staying at the Imperial is sitting in the lobby and watching Japanese people in gorgeous kimonos attending weddings and other events. Often you will see a newly wedded couple getting pictures taken on the stairs. Overall, I would stay at another Tokyo hotel if it weren't for the company discount.  ",162
"Very nice - great service Nice, higher end hotel tucked in between the edge of the publicly open part of the Imperial palace and Maruno-uchi/Tokyo station, this hotel offered me a nice, spacious room with a view, free hi-speed Internet, great location and awesome service. I always enjoy escaping America and leaving behind a culture of indiscipline and customer disservice from hotel employees. All employees at the Imperial (and typically ANY Japanese hotel) will offer helpful, friendly service with a thank you and a smile; the extra bene of the Imperial is that they also do it in English.I was in a spacious and clean room with a king bed and large bathroom on the 6th floor. Granted, one could simply go downstairs for a meal, but I suggest to the more daring to step out either down to the sublevel outside one block and grab a bite at one of the many places in the Metro underground, or exit out the back of the hotel, walk past the train line and one can find a multitude of little, tasty - and nicely priced - bakeries or breakfast shops and restaurants.In the tower extension of the hotel is a great Japanese style bath and sauna - ultra clean and perfect way to relax away (also not crowded - but do expect to pay 1,050 yen for the experience.All-in-all, this place has everything the travel needs - centrally located on the subway system, or a short walk to Tokyo station. I highly recommend the Imperial.  ",163
"Baaaaaad attitude, just ok hotel The hotel is better than some in Japan, but not worth the money. A lot of attitude at the front desk and kind of old surroundings. Needs some updating of the interiors.I was staying on a business trip with others, and one day a colleague disappeared with my key while planning a presentation. When I went to the front desk, I got quizzed about why I needed an extra key. What happened to your key? I don't know, I think I lost it....I'm here with friends and one took the key... (etc) Apparently this was just too much for the front desk staff because they kind of freaked out. There was a lot of discussion in Japanese, and until I asked, What's the big problem? they did not tell me what was going on. Then they said, Oh, sorry sir, we will get you a key. Then they disappeared in the back and didn't come out for around 5 minutes.Then they gave me two keys and said, We'll have to charge you for the second key. !!!!!! They thought there was someone else staying in my room....Whatever. I guess Lost in Translation was a true story.  ",164

"Good but some problems. We had great expectations from this hotel. The price, its reputation and the reviews we had read made us think that this was going to be a once in a lifetime experience. Nothing was wrong really, but we didn't have such experience. We found it to be a good hotel, very expensive, but apart from the impressive lobby we were not impressed. Room was large (for a double) but we had paid for a triple, and we found that the third bed was just a sofa bed which hadn't been made yet when we got to your room. Reception was quite impersonal, nothing wrong with it, but we were obviously not the type of customers the hotel caters for. We couldn't use the pool for free because we were not members of the club. We could not become members because we didn't have our business cards. Location isn't bad at all, it's a few minutes away from JR Yamanote line and the subway, but if you want ot go to Shinjuku you have a good half an hour travelling to do. Internet was available for free, but in a small room which had to be opened especially for you if out of business hours. If you are looking for a once in a lifetime experience like we were, then probably the New Otani Hotel will suit you better.  ",166
"Incredible service We just returned from a Cruise West tour of Japan. Our final couple of days was at the Imperial in Tokyo. This is a classic old hotel beautifuly maintained and with the most service I've ever experienced in a hotel. The other hotels we experienced in Japan were 'Okuras and were excellent. We thought the service from them was great but the Imperial was in yet another class. There is no tipping in Japan but notwithstanding the staff was there virtually without asking or even necessarily being wanted. Certainly the Japanese folks frequenting the hotel seemed to expect the degree of service we observed, we though experienced travellers were somewhat amazed by it. The facility is excellent, the food venues were quite good, though as with most things in Japan expensive. We were given a 20% discount as hotel guests which helped. The rooms though excellent did not have irons and ironing boards in them though they were available for the asking. Other amenities of fine hotels were present. The hotel's distinguishing characteristics for us were location and service. The service excellence was enough to prompt this review.  ",167

The best thing of the hotel is his location in the center of the city, easy to shoping, visits, dinnig and go out.We enjoyed very much our stayed here, we felt very safe and in the midle of everything.

"Wonderful place! Great hotel, incredibly helpful and friendly staff, very comfortable rooms. Conveniently located, in walking distance to Ginza district.  ",170
"Great Location and Service Very nice hotel with an excellent staff. Ate at a few of the many restaurants and they were all nice. I generally avoid hotel restaurants but they all were highly recommended by the locals. In all, a great stay.  ",171
"Great location! Stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip, in the tower block. I was on the 28th floor, with a beautiful view of the city. The rooms here are a little tired, although I understand that there are some upgraded rooms elsewhere in the hotel. It is a very large hotel, so I had some trouble navigating within the hotel in the beginning.The best part about this hotel is its location. You can step right out into Ginza where all the shops and restaurants are. The train station is at the doorstep as well. Service is excellent. My only gripe is that they charge 1000Y for use of the gym.  ",172

Excellent Hospitality The Imperial Hotel is conveniently located across the street from the Imperial Palace grounds. The service and hospitality are unmatched. Hotel staff is everywhere and they go out of their way to help. We only ate breakfast there and the buffet was huge. It 's cool to see a chef make an omelet with chopsticks!  ,174
"Nice location, fantastic service in spite of the size Great location (Ginza) and close to the subway. Renovated rooms (ask for a renovated room...) are superb, large with all the services one could expect. Reasonabely priced for the quality and ...Tokyo  ",175
"Super High-tech room in the Main Building! I have stayed at this hotel a few times. I got very luckey once and they upgraded me to a nice room in the main building, although I was paying for a single room in the tower building. While the room in the tower building is very decent, the renovated room in the main building was amazing. The room had two queen size beds with bench at the end, couch, coffee table, flat screen TV, fax machine etc. You could open/close the curtains by pressing the button on the night stand (actually, everthing is controlled by the panel on the night stand). There is a digital control panel on the wall for AC, and air purifier. The bathroom came with a tub that filled automatically to the temperature you like, and played a little music when it was filled, and oh, there was a small flat screen TV over the vanity. The room was so spacious it's almost as big as my apartment without the kitchen. The room service was excellent. I called for breakfast and it came within 5 minutes. Front desk personnel are always helpful with any request. Be sure to sign up for Imperial Club, if you are a foregin business traveler. That way, you can use fitness center for free, discount on dry cleaning etc. I've stayed at other hotels in Tokyo, but this one tops my list for location, service and comfort. I also like to run, so being close to a good running course like the loop around Imperial Palace is always a plus.  ",176
"As close to perfect as you can get Stayed there three nights on the last leg of an around the world business trip. It may lack flair, but it is as close to perfect as a hotel can be. From the moment I got out of the taxi to the moment I boarded the Narita bus, everything was handled perfectly. The room was very comfortable鈥攕imple perhaps in its decor but a very elegant oasis for a tired traveler. The old Frank Lloyd Wright Imperial Bar is still there. If you are looking for flash, there are other excellent hotels but this place gets my vote. Also great location, right near the Ginza and a Tokyo subway as well as across forma part and near the palace.  ",177
"Good hotel but found the colors so depressing Good hotel, great service but just not my kind of hotel..found the beiges and browns rather depressing and the walk through the hotel to get outside quite long..Of course that is what you can expect in such a big hotel..Location is really good!  ",178

"Extraordinary Staff I've stayed at the Imperial Hotel several times and always found it to be a top-quality hotel. However, this last visit an incident occurred which showed me how helpful the staff can be. My colleague and I were schedule to catch an early bus to the airport. About 15 minutes before the bus was to depart, I became concerned that my colleague had not come down to the lobby yet. I asked the help desk to call his room - they told me the phone was busy, so I assumed he was awake and making a last minute phone call. Then without my prompting, the help desk began to investigate and found he had not responded to his earlier wake-up call. The manager in charge went up to his room and determined he was still asleep. He came back and asked my permission to wake him up. We both went back up to the room, woke him up and got him to the bus (which they managed to hold for us). At least 4 or 5 hotel staff helped us in the endeavor. Never have I seen such an extraordinary hotel staff.  ",180

"Great Stay/Great Location Recently stayed 9 nights at the Imperial. Membership in the Imperial Club brought a 20% discount on a deluxe room as well as 50% reduction in laundry charges, and a 10% reduction on in-hotel restaurant charges and we used all of these.Room measureed approximately 23 X 26 feet not including the entry hall; bathroom the typical walk-in shower with separate tub measured 10 X 10. GREAT water pressure in the shower..you didn't want to get out it felt so good.The usual Imperial excellent housekeeping and wonderful service, particularly from the Concierge and the front desk folks.Pricey to eat in the Viking Sal buffet even with a discount and on some mornings there were a lot of folks eating and the table service a bit lacking; excellent choices in terms of food to include the made-to-order omelets.Airport limo to Narita can be arranged in-lobby and the hotel is that particular route's first stop. Metro connection across the street; Ginza shopping, Kabuki-za, lots of restaurants within a couple of blocks as well as convenience stores, small public park, etc.Lots of business folks (both Japanese and western) in the lobby every morning but also many Japanese travelers.If you like staying in this particular section of Tokyo, and we do, then the Imperial cannot be beat IMO. Pricey but worth it.  ",182
"Stay at the Imperial, feel like royalty My stay at the Imperial Hotel was truly wonderful. It is centrally located, serviced by the Airport Limousine Bus regularly, very close to two subway stations and Ginza is only a short walk away. Moreover, the service is breathtakingly efficient. Hardly able to keep my eyes open after a 12-hour flight, check-in was completed in 2 minutes flat and I was led to my room immediately. The service is fabulous and staff seems to sense what the guest wants before he knows it himself. Whenever I walked into the lobby with so much as a questioning look on my face, staff immediately offered their assistance and if they could not help themselves, they would make sure their colleagues would attend to me immediately. I felt truly special. It is not a cheap hotel but worth splurging on.  ",183
A grand hotel! Was on business travel. I booked this hotel twice. This is a very very nice hotel with great service. I love the location in the Ginza area. Easy walking to shopping and terrific eating.  ,184
"Not worth the money I have been visiting Japan 2 - 3 times per year for over 10 years now and I have never been treated this poorly. The room I stayed in was old, I asked for a non-smoking room and they gave me a smoking room. Service is slow and of very poor quality for a Japanese hotel. If you are staying in Tokyo I would highly recommend the Palace hotel and Strings Hotel. The Palace is near Tokyo station and Strings is near Shinagawa station, both are very convenient.  ",185
"Love the hotel The Imperial Hotel in Tokyo is an excellent place because of the location and great service. It is within walking distance to trains, Ginza shopping district, park, great restaurants (inexpensive and expensive ones) and movie theatres. Views from the room (Tower annex) are spectacular if you like to see end to end rooftops of buildings and skyscrapers. The view was better seven years ago. Used to be able to see the Odaiba (man-made island) and the Rainbow Bridge. Now new taller buildings are blocking a lot of the view. However, one can still get an unobtructed view of the railroad tracks where the infamous bullet trains run. Service personnel are top-notched. Most of the rooms have been updated. They must have used the Peninsula's interior designer. Room rates are lower than the other newer five-star hotels in the area. The only peeve I have with the hotel are the elevators. Although waiting time is almost nonexistent, they must do something about the climate control. One elevator can feel like a freezer while another feels like a sauna!  ",186
"Utterly Superb Imperial Hotel TokyoThis hotel is undoubtedly the finest I have ever stayed in. It is one of the very few I shall remember for all the right reasons. It is also the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed in, but it was not 鈥榦ver the top鈥?expensive 鈥?better value than London or New York. I found a variety of different prices for this place, but I found the best deal was with the hotel direct 鈥?they seemed to have some special deals on when we booked and these couldn鈥檛 be beaten. Some people may be put off by its sheer size 鈥?it is hugeWe were lucky enough to have got an upgrade from a 鈥楳oderate鈥?to a 鈥楧eluxe鈥?on the 14th floor of the main building, and it probably is the only time in my life I have walked into a hotel room and said 鈥淲OW鈥? I sense the reason we got the upgrade was due to a tip I received to become members of the Imperial Club. This is free, and definitely worth it. I obtained my membership through their London office, and it was conducted by fax. It also offers additional benefits such as 10% off any restaurant bill and free use of the very excellent and utterly spotless leisure facilities. The room was incredible. A large 32鈥?LCD TV, every conceivable comfort feature you could wish for 鈥?including would you believe it a toilet with a heated seat and various options such as 鈥榖idet鈥?and 鈥榮pray鈥?settings!! The detailed touches were also memorable, such as courtesy lights under the bedside units, which were useful if you needed to go to the loo in the night without disturbing your partner. In addition to the bedside lamp, there was also a bedside reading lamp, which was very directional, again so you could read without disturbing your partner. The service was almost too much! The staff seemed almost to fall over themselves to help. It must have one of the highest staff to guest ratios I have ever come across. There were ladies on the floor who greeted you as you stepped out of the lift. Despite the busy location, we never heard any external noise. I note others have recommended use of the Limousine Bus service to and from the airport. We used this, and can only endorse the other positive views. (Believe a taxi is eye wateringly expensive). We used the metro system to get around. Once tuned into the system, it was quick, cheap, and efficient. Stations names are in Japanese characters as well as Roman, so no problem there, although streetmaps were a bit daunting as not all streets have names, and there is little logic to the numbering system. However, the Hotel provided a useful map which identified landmarks to help you (eg the hotel itself, the Sony building etc.)We ate in on one evening out of the three we were there. I was quite expensive, but the meal was excellent. There are about 12 restaurants to choose from offering different types of cuisine include French, Chinese and Japanese. If you do find the prices a bit over the top, there are numerous restaurants in the immediate vicinity at varying price levels. Breakfasts too were very good. Overall, although fairly expensive, I would still describe it as good value. I always ask myself would 鈥淚 stay here again?鈥?An unhesitating 鈥榊es鈥?  ",187
"Reliable, Great Location We often stay at the Imperial and I agree with the other reviewers: it has a somewhat dated look (which I like) and it's very centrally located. All I want to add is that the staffing levels and service very impressive given how expensive Japan is. There are always loads of people around to answer questions and help out and the concierges are very helpful. Also, we tried some of the hotel restaurants this time around and really liked them. I adore wandering the back streets of Ginza while my husband is working and have bought many Japanese prints from Watanabe's little shop and gorgeous housewares from Matsuya department store. It's lovely to have the park right in front and there are plenty of places to eat nearby. Coffee drinkers may be pleased to know that Starbucks is right next door.  ",188

"My First Tokyo Hotel The Imperial Hotel was the first hotel I ever stayed at in Japan. I was 9 years old accompanying my father on a trip. He had been gone from home a lot and with Vietnam heating up, knew he would be gone a lot more so he took me along for some quality father/son time. Ever since then the Imperial has been a favorite of mine. There are things I like better about the Hotel Okura and especially the Palace Hotel, but the Imperial will always be first in my heart.And it remains there because they do a darn good job of anticipating every need a businessman might have. I also love the pool area and the restaurants.  ",191
"Register for the Club... Foreign travellers should register for the Imperial Club, at the hotel website, before departure. I have been to this hotel over 10 times over the past 15 years, and I just discovered you can register online if you are a foreign guest. This gets you an upgrade (I believe) to the club floors, which are better rooms (read -- updated) than the regular rooms. They are also larger, I believe, and the bathroom is much, much nicer. The Club also comes with other perks and discounts.Service is the high point at this hotel, and the convenient location next to Business, the Palace and Ginza. The rooms are an afterthought. Food is famously expensive at the hotel, but a quick step outside of the hotel will yield dozens of restaurants of every type and price point, with most restaurants priced very affordably (for a Californian). Other tips:The Limosine Bus stops directly at the hotel, which I prefer to the Narita Express due to the convenience of a single stop.  ",192

"More than good but not excellent Stayed 5 nights at Imperial Hotel Tokyo for my business trip in Feb and have some comments as follow :Location : excellent location if you work around Tokyo and Ginza Station. But it is not convenient going to shopping and leisure places in Tokyo downtown, ie, Shinjuku and Roppogi.Reception : Most of them can speak excellent English upon check-in. They were fast and efficient but without any warm greeting. Ladies at Guest Relations are supreme - could answer me every single questions. If they were not sure, they checked with the collegues or searched at the internet to find it out. And they helped me book an excellent Japanese restaurant with my boss in the evening. Conceige : I needed to be patient with them as some of them cannot speak English well. The day I left was the day of Tokyo Marathon, most of the roads around the hotel were blocked for the Campaign. I was told I needed to take Limo bus at the temperory bus stop at the back entrance upon check-out. When I asked to get back my lugguges after going back from lunch, the bell boy brought them to the front entrance but he could not explain it to me very well so I needed to ask couple staffs to find out the campaign was finished and every arrangement was back to normal. Room : Our rooms are located at the top floor of New Wing. We thought we were upgraded to the better room category. Unfortuately, they are same quality as the rooms at the other floors. The bell boy told us we would be upgraded if we becomes members of the hotel. Room is spacious and clean but with 80's deco. I think it matches with the overall deco of the hotel. Bedding is a concern - mattress and pillow are too soft to me. They do not provide duvet during winter (I have requested about it) and it's polyester/cotton heavy qulit with the small cotton flat sheet underneath which made me uncomfortable and needed to adjust it all over the night to avoid any contact with the quilt. Restaurant : average quality but expensive, cheese platter (with 3 half finger size cheese and it's not tasty) at about 1800 yen plus tax ; about 1500 yen plus tax of a glass of house wine. Fortuately, I got a 20% off coupon for the meal or beverage during check-in. Tips : I found aroung 40-50 restaurants and bars at the road just in front of the hotel. Most of them closed late and food is reasonable and not expensive relatively.  ",194
good but not so good I spent 3 nights in an imperial floor room in January. There was some confusion with my booking which was quickly sorted out. Check - in was rushed and very average - there was a huge queue which moved along quickly.My room was very nicely appointed with a great view. There was a special attendant who rushed to offer any assistance when required . It is a huge hotel - and the lobby was always crowded . The bell staff were unfriendly and unsmiling - not even in response to a greeting/hello.Location is great - walking distance to underground staion as well as to Ginza.  ,195
"Average Business Hotel This hotel is huge. It was hard to get around and took about 10 minutes for us to get to our rooms...especially since there was only one route. The rooms are basic and are in need of renovations. Everything was old, including the TV and channel/movie selections. The location was great...within walking distance to the Hibiya Line (subway) and the JR Yamonote Line (train). It was also in Ginza, which has a lot of nice stores and restaurants. The concierge service was very good and there was always someone available to help us. However, I don't think it's a good value. I think there are many nicer hotels in this price range.  ",196
"As everyone says - it's great! My family and I stayed at the Imperial Hotel for two nights. We stayed at the Snoopy Heartful Stay Suite, which was a suite based on Snoopy, the World Famous Beagle who appears in the Peanuts comics. Once you went inside, there was a very cute Snoopy interior mat. There was a sofa, and two armchairs beside it. On one armchair, was the biggest Snoopy stuffed animal I had ever seen! It was so big it would suffocate a baby if he slept with it. On the table were two tote bags with gifts inside. It was a tiny cheese plate and a mug cup! There were also two coupons for Snoopy pancakes at the Eureka Restaurant - 10% off! We never got to using them because we were so busy in Tokyo - shopping, and all that stuff. The beds were very comfortable and I got a very much needed sleep. The blankets had Snoopy, Charlie Brown, and Woodstock carefully embroidered. On each of our two beds was a Snoopy and Charlie Brown cushion. In the bathroom, there was a Snoopy hairdryer! And beautiful Snoopy bathrobes and towels. Now, besides the Snoopy suite which excited us so much, the dining here is wonderful. The buffet (or viking) is wonderful. Be sure to try their ham there, if possible. It's wonderful! If you get the half grapefruit, it's carefully cut so that it is easy to spoon out each piece. The value is well worth it. It's kind of pricey, but you get what you pay for. The service here is extreme!!!!! Everyone treats you like royalty, and like you are some celebrity. Overall, it was an awesome stay, my family loved it, and I highly recommend it!!!!  ",197
"Certainly the best hotel I've ever stayed at! Having lived in Japan for a number of years, I can tell you that no other hotel gets the same reaction from the locals as the Imperial. Tell a Japanese person that you鈥檝e stayed there and they will give you a look that comes dangerously close to wonder. Of course, reputation is one thing, reality is another. Recently my wife and I were invited to stay there by my visiting mother-in-law. As the title of the review states, I was pretty impressed 鈥?although I would point out that I don鈥檛 usually stay at top of the range luxury hotels that often鈥?The hotel is huge (1000+ rooms! 13 restaurants! bars! shops!), the service was impeccable (and in English), the rooms were comfortable and fully equipped, and the food at the restaurants we sampled was excellent, although expensive. The location too is very convenient, within walking distance of a range of train and subway stations giving you easy access to the rest of the city.So if you鈥檙e in Tokyo and have some cash to burn, do yourself a favour and book in 鈥?and try the mixed western/Japanese breakfast buffet at the Viking restaurant while you鈥檙e at it. Mmm鈥?delicious...  ",198
"Teikoku (Imperial) Hotel - The very best The Grand Dame of Tokyo Hotels. Elegant, Frank Lloyd Wright design, superb location, impeccable service, history - the Teikoku Hotel (Japanese name) has it all. Tsukamoto-san, the General Manager, is a true gentleman. I have stayed here several times both by myself and with my family and I am looking forward to my next visit.  ",199
"Great Stay The Imperial Hotel is an extremely large hotel that's always swarming with activity. My family and I stayed for four days and there was a huge wedding or other large function each night. We enjoyed the activity but those seeking a tranquil setting should stay elsewhere. The service is terrific. As for the rooms, the Imperial is two hotels in one. The standard rooms, particularly in the new wing, have decor/furnishings comparable to a Holiday Inn - clean and not cramped but definitely not fancy. Rooms on the Imperial Floors in the main building are completely different and rival those found in Ritz Carltons but you're charged commensurately. We enjoyed our stay very much - especially the location which is adjacent to the Imperial Palace and walking distance to Ginza.  ",200
"Great Service! Just came back from a 3 nights stay at the Imperial Hotel. This is my children's first visit to Japan and both of them were very impressed when the greeting ladies bowed every time our elevator door closed on the G/F.We booked a room with 3 beds, and when we arrived and told them that our children will share a bed, Housekeeping came within 5 minutes and provided everything for the 4th person in the room. When he saw the children, he immediately brought slippers in children size. Truely 5 class service.Not to mention a great location. We had fun choosing between all the restaurants underneath the railway track.For sure we will go back to the Imperial next time we are in Tokyo.  ",201
"Convenient Business Hotel Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Imperial. It is a very large business hotel that does a sizable wedding business on weekends. As tourists, we were happy with the hotel's location near reasonable and fun restaurants (yakitori joints under the rail tracks), lots of shopping (think Ginza), and access to metro lines. Though staff was exceedingly courteous, we found the concierges to be especially helpful. Most standard rooms are located in the new Tower building. Our room was large and decorated in dated colors and furnishings but everything was in tip top shape. Most Tower rooms have fabulous views of the Ginza, especially at night. It is a long walk to the Tower rooms from the main lobby, however. The convenient location will bring us back to the Imperial on future trips to Tokyo.  ",202

"OK hotel, anoying location The Shinjuku New City Hotel was a perfectly adequate hotel. While it was dated, my room was large, quiet and clean and the bed was fairly comfortable. The staff were efficient and all spoke good English and I had no hassles checking in or out. The only thing which bugged me about the hotel was that accessing the internet is very expensive (100 yen for 10 minutes).Despite that, I wouldn't recommend this hotel for tourists due to its annoying location. The hotel is a boring 15-20 minute walk to Shinjuku Station (which is the closest interchange station - Tochame station is about 5 minutes away, but is only on one line, and it's not easy to change lines in the vast Shinjuku station) . To make matters worse I couldn't find any interesting restaurants (or many restaurants at all) closer than the station area. This probably isn't an issue if you're traveling for business and are working in west Shinjuku, but for tourists its a real pain to face a long and uninteresting walk every time you come and go from the hotel. It would be worth paying a bit more to be closer to the station and Shinjuku's excellent shops and nightlife.  ",225
"Beware aircon and heating not working in Oct I booked this hotel through asiarooms.com, which advertised heating and cooling. After payment went through, they then sent an email saying that repairs were being done throughout October and the hotel would provide extra bedclothes if you are cold! Unless you don't mind not having any heating or cooling, I suggest choosing elsewhere.  ",226
"Good value for money - would recommend I spent a lot of time researching hotels in Tokyo and thought this one looked like the best value for money in a good location. And fortunately, I wasn't wrong. Yes, it is a little dated... and perhaps the 'new' should be amended to '70s' but it is clean, convenient, has a/c (which is an absolute must at this time of year), and has internet access (not wireless unfortunately) in the room.As already mentioned by some of these reviews, the bathroom is a little small but since Tokyo is limited on space and the nation doesn't have a problem with obesity, it's understandable. And the shower is great which is a massive plus. The really odd thing about the toilet is that it starts to flush as soon as you sit down (I think I read somewhere that the Japanese do this to mask natural noises!) - the only problem with this is if you are sharing a room and have to get up in the middle of the night and are trying to be as quiet as possible!Other than that, there is everything you'd expect from a hotel (plus kimonos and slippers!) and it is good to have the BBC world service (what would we do with out the BBC?) on tv.  ",227
"Great location, great service, wonderful people I am pleased that I could travel to Tokyo, met those people, and stayed in a hotel like this. I lived on the 14th floor for 10 nights and the view and the whole thing was just amazing. You won't get a much better room or kinder treatment in the Hilton on the opposite side of the park but it will cost you at least two times more. This is a good budget hotel and has everything you need to spend your nights there.They have a coach to and from the Shinjuku train station which is quite handy if it's raining but you should also try the moving pavements in the tunnel from the station to the Government Buildings.I would not hesitate staying here again any time.

"Good Value, Location Hotel We were surpriesed that the rooms were spacious and clean, and the location of the hotel is good and they have shutter service to the shinjuku station which is 5mins away.

"Great 2 weeks I am from Perth, australia and we just returned from 2 weeks at Shinjuku New City Hotel. I stayed with my 12yo and 7yo. It was brilliant. We had a triple room, which i thought was a great size, service was excellent, it was no fuss. I took my laptop and used their internet connection kit - i used the internet to stay in touch with home and to plan our next day's activities and work out the trains etc. it was great. the internet was free. there are some computers at reception for public use.There are many convenience stores in the area - say 4 within a couple of hundred metres of the hotel. You can buy nearly everything at these stores - meals included - they will heat them up for you if you need to. There are at least 2 McDonalds (i did have a 7yo boy...) within very easy walking and many, many eating places close by.The Park across the road is excellent and we spent a bit of time there too. totally safe and many, many local families used the park. The stray cats with mangled tails did catch our attention tho...Homeless people - some people have commented on this - they are absolutely no problem at all, they do not look at you, they keep to themselves and do not interact. we found them harmless and fascinating (yet sad) - they are a part of Tokyo - all over Tokyo, not just in this suburb.Coin Laundry!!!!! - we had to ask reception a couple of times - but they came through with a map and it was within 2MINUTES walking from the hotel. 24 hour coin laundry. it was great.Shuttle bus - absolutely brililant - we used it every day, we found it easy to find and always on time. We also walked to and from shinjuku station all the time - at all hours of the day. There was absolutely no question of ever feeling unsafe - remember i was with 2 kids also - the latest we walked home from 11.30 at night though - to most japanese people this isnt regarded as 'night time'.Taxis - there are taxis everywhere! They do not speak english and will need you to point to a map or have an address written in Kanji.Smoking - for a supposedly non smoking floor - no one obeys this rule. it did bother us a fair bit that we could smell the people from the next room. we foudn that most rooms around us were business people staying for 1 night.We found that the guests were mostly Japanese people - either touring in their own country, large school groups or business people. Some foreignors - but not many. Our room did not have a view - we looked out onto the next apartment building. this didnt worry us at all. The building is being renovated and the outside of the front of it has netting over it so at the moment - the views wouldnt be great.Daily cleaning - the state of the room was very clean. You are expected to be out of your room by 930 or 10am every day while the cleaners do all rooms on 1 floor. sometimes this bothered us as we could never sleep in - but then again it got us up and moving. We could have always put a Do not disturb sign up, but we just used the reason to get out for the day.the bathroom is a small 'unit' with a shower over a bath with a toilet and basin. Totally usable and great.The pillows - some people have commented on these. Ours were half and half - half western style on 1 side and if you turned it over you got the rice husk side. You could choose.The beds were wonderful and made up each day with clean sheets.Food - we didnt have breakfast included and we never ate at the restaurant so i cannot comment.I hope this has helped some people, especially those with families. I would choose this place again. It is a business hotel - meaning you dont get the gloss and glitter, just good basic services as a good price. that is what i wanted.Leisa from Perth, WA  ",234
"Good Location-Value for money Good location..close enough to Shinjuku station for an easy walk.Hotel shuttle bus available, but can be tricky to find the first time.Rooms average size for japan, and very clean.Decor a little dated.Counter service average. Would saty there again  ",235
"Adequate, Clean Hotel We went for the super-delux room, since it had a bigger bed. It was still smallish by American standards, but the room was clean and quiet. The shower was hot with a strong water flow. The bed headboard has these 70's style controls for the lights, alarm, air conditioner, etc, but it has a particular retro charm. The staff was friendly and helpful. There's also a free hotel shuttle that will take you to the Shinjuku Station, while not important since you can walk there, it is helpful when you get ready to leave and have luggage with you. There's also internet in the lobby for 100 yen per ten minutes. There's no room service but there's a vending machine for sodas, water, beer, shaving kits and Japanese snacks near the elevators. The location is good, next to a quiet park and close to Shinjuku station, where you can catch a subway to another district. Next to the hotel is a coffee shop for those that love coffee. However, it is not open on Sunday (or if it is, it opens late). Getting there: take the Narita Express from the airport to the Shinjuku station. Take the east exit and then hail a taxi. Have the address written down and the driver will punch it in his GPS. Costs about $7-$8 to take a taxi from Shinjuku station to the hotel. You can book through expedia or travelocity, but it's cheaper to book through the hotels website.  ",236

"I won't stay there again My friend and I stayed there for 5 nites and both of us hated it. Since we have paid for the whole stay before we got there, we did not have option to change the hotel. The rooms were very small and have some bad smell (we both are 5ft 2 girls). We booked a twin bed room and they gave us a queen size bed room due to no more rooms availble. So we had to wait until somebody check out. The staffs were not friendly at all except ony one. I don't know if because their culture, I don't think they repect women. They are pretty rude when I asked them questions compare to other Japanese people. With the room price they charged, I for sure can find better hotel. My friend said it is wose than Motel 6 in the US.  ",238
"Good value, great location The Shinjuku station is overwhelmingly big and crowded and it is extremely difficult to find the correct exit to catch the hotel's courtesy bus, if you are not familiar with it and are saddled with heavy suitcases on arrival. But this hotel is not far from the station by taxi - and therefore a reasonable price to pay for comfort. Taxi drivers are well aware of this hotel; they are also very honest and therefore won't take you via Mt Fuji. (They won't accept tips either!)My first impression of this hotel was mixed. I wasn't expecting such a huge chandelier in the lobby of a 2 star hotel and there was a strange, almost unpleasant, smell in the place. (But that was the only time I really noticed it).The staff at the reception desk were friendly, polite, spoke English and treated us with the usual Japanese respect. Booking in was efficient and the lifts were so appreciated. Our room was basic - neither small nor large and quite adequate for our needs. The beds were comfortable and I was pleased to note that this Japanese hotel had western type pillows. In the past I have stayed in hotels where they had pillows which appeared to be stuffed with rice husks.Everything was spotlessly clean and well maintained. Our bathroom was terrific, it included a very modern toilet with more buttons than I knew what to do with, and there was also a deep Japanese bath to relax in.There was a window, but the view was only suitable if you wanted to spend your days watching what other people were doing in their rooms across the way. (Like the lady who spent ages with a toothbrush and Jiff, cleaning the bird poo off her window sills).We did not try the breakfasts in the hotel as we bought our food at a convenience store only a few doors down the street. It was very handy and they sold almost everything. We did try the Mermaid Restaurant and enjoyed a few lovely dinners there. Part of my enjoyment of that restaurant was the fact that you could sit at a table, eat and watch people pass by (whilst smoking a cigarette after the meal - something unheard of now, in our neck of the woods.)Once we were free of toting our luggage, we took full advantage of the courtesy bus and found it to be absolutely punctual and perfect for our needs. Although we were still struggling to find the correct exit on the way out of the station, until I had the bright idea to ask the man at reception to write the name of the exit on a piece of paper in Japanese - which we then flashed in front of whoever offered to help us when we looked lost. It worked like a charm.The actual location of the hotel is excellent. So close to the Shinjuku city centre and station, near a nice park and within an easy walking distance of the Government towers (which provide as good a view as the Tokyo tower without the queues and tourist fees.)Yes, we did see several homeless people in the park near the Government buildings but they were certainly not urinating in public. They sat reading their papers, or dozing, next to their bikes and boxes and minded their own business. They did not threaten us or make us feel unsafe. One of them was actually busy washing his clothes with soap and water from the public tap. Just because someone is homeless does not automatically make them a low character!  ",239
"overall a great experience If you don't know Shinjuku station very well, then I would suggest that on your arrival, you take a taxi to the hotel. The daily shuttle is a great service provided by the hotel, but it is tricky to find the location of the shuttle if you don't know where to look. The taxi ride costs only the basic fare of 640 Yen. The location of this hotel is really great though and only a very short walk up the road to the neon lights of Electric Street where you can find many Japanese style eateries amongst the hubbub of people out shopping for bargains. The hotel room was very good for the price and the English speaking staff were generally very helpful. Each morning, the breakfast (included in our package) was tasy and provided both western style and Japanese. My one complaint is that because we travelled with a child, we were forced to book a triple room, and despite booking and requesting a queen size bed some 5 months in advance, the hotel was unable to accomodate our request. My husband and I spent the whole week in rather hard single beds with possibly the hardest, most uncomfortable pillows in the world! Overall though, we had a great stay and would definitely recommend the Shinjuku New City Hotel, just on location alone.  ",240
"Bad, unwelcoming, poor service, tiny room I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worse enemies DOG. I can honestly say that this Hotel has NOTHING going for it. It's location is a 15min stroll from Shinjuku station but dont be surprised if you see homeless people urinating on the walkways. The area is really run down and is home to many homeless people. Although the hotel (I dont think it can be called a hotel) has a shuttle bus, it only runs from 7:30am - 12pm and 4pm - 10pm. Not to mention the size is not big enough to fit the HUGE amount of guests staying at the hotel. I have also never experienced a hotel that requires FULL payment on arrival. The hotel asked for the full amount prior to even seeing the hotel room which I thought was dodgy and questioned but they insisted it was hotel policy. I now know why they ask for the $$$ on arrival. The rooms are tiny and we were given a King size SINGLE (non exagerration) for the two of us to sleep on. We told the hotel that we had booked a Double room and they said that it was their Double room. If you are considering booking this hotel due to it's relative cheap price, I would recommend you check the room before handing over the $$$. We were going to change hotels until we realised it was an 80% cancellation fee. Dont expect to be spoken to in English. Have your dictionaries and thinking caps on when trying to communicate. However, the Hotel must be commended on its excellent cleanliness which was flawless.  ",241
"70s style in shinjuku This hotel is a great find. The lobby's 70s style chandeliers are probably its most distinguished decorative feature, but the rooms are clean, pleasant and fairly spacious and the windows open, which does not appear to be a given in Japan. The staff are friendly and although you need to know the timetable to get much use out of the shuttle bus it's a short walk to Shinjuku station through a small park and past the iconic Municipal Government Towers.There are intruiging refreshment options in the vending machines on each floor but the hotel's one downside is its overpriced restaurant. Whilst are plenty of other lunch and dinner options in the immediate area, you may find yourself stuck for breakfast. If you are too hungry to walk to the station there's a convenience store a couple of minutes away (go out of the hotel and turn right). A minute further is the Park Hyatt Hotel where you can spend the money you saved on accommodation in the New York Grill.  ",242
"Great Location, Great Price Great location - one block from the Government Towers and 15mins walk to Shinjuku station. The surrounding area is safe and quiet. Our triple room was clean and spacious. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. This is a great place to stay in Shinjuku.  ",243
"Good hotel Shinjuku New City is a decent hotel, the rooms are small (no cupboard) but well-equipped with toothbrush, pyjamas if you need them, etc. There is coin operated internet access in the lobby and a passable if bland restaurant. They can post your cards or letters for you which is handy and there is a shuttle bus to and from Shinjuku station which is very useful.  ",244
"Great Value We (3 adults) just got back from our stay here and overall, it was a good experience - with a couple of catches. First, mid-Sept proved to be quite hot in Tokyo with the usual high humidity. The hotel air conditioning was working, but not that strong. When the weather cooled down, the hotel was much more enjoyable. Second, the location is great (quiet and a bit residential feeling) and a bit of a walk to Shinjuku Station (15 minutes or so). The free shuttle is convenient and used frequently by hotel guests. Regarding the room, I somehow neglected to take any photos of it, but it was exactly as pictured on their webpage. We reserved the triple room and we were not disappointed. The staff was extremely helpful and even ordered a Domino's Pizza for us during the only break we took away from the great Japanese food of Tokyo. Only on the last day did we actually explore the immediate area around the hotel and we all felt that we should have not defaulted to getting to Shinjuku Station so early each morning and instead, tried to discover the nuisances around our hotel. The overwhelming-ness of Shinjuku Station is legendary and it also did not disappoint so, the New City Hotel's area is a nice break. We ate at the hotel breakfast buffet (about $17 USD p/p) and it was okay. Half Japanese food and half American/Western food. The hotel primarily caters towards Japanese guests (about 99 percent - I would estimate) and that actually added to the ambiance. This is not a Marriott nor did I want it to be. The rooms are cleaned each morning at about 10am via an orchestrated army of personnel wherein the entire floor of rooms have the doors opened and the service commences. It is actually quite a site to behold, so I think if you are hoping for a late checkout I just do not see how it would be possible. The 100 yen / 10 minute internet computer in the lobby was handy and generally available (as there are 4 or 5 terminal, I think). Would I stay here again? Yes. I would probably choose another district - just for a change of scenery, but the hotel was a great value for the location and it's proximity.  ",245
"Review Of The New City Hotel, Shinjuku. By Tokyo standards this hotel was very cheap. I booked on-line via their own dedicated website and got my single room for about 拢43 per night. This was in December 2004. As I recall the double/twin was only about 拢65, again, very cheap for Tokyo. We had originally tried to book the Shinjuku Washington but it's ancient website had a bug which wouldn't allow us to complete the booking and when my Japanese friend called to make a reservation they wouldn't honour theInternet Special price, despite the fact the website wasn't working!Having stayed in Tokyo on two previous ocassions the size of the room was a pleasent surprise. Obviously it was a good bit smaller than we're used to in the West but it was by no means as small as the rabbit hutches I'd stayed in previously. Enough room for a table and chairs though wardrobe space was limited.The room was superclean and well equipped although a bit tired looking. Staff were OK though we didn't really have much need to call on their help at any point. Those we did speak to spoke good English.there are two internet terminals located in the lobby.Where the New City comes into it's own though is in location. It's about a ten minute walk down a straight road from the heart of Shinjuku which to my mind is the perfect Tokyo location in terms of convenience for the rest of the city and also because there's so much for you to do right on your doorstep.If you can't be bothered with the ten minute walk there's a free mini bus which leaves every half hour and takes you to Shinjuku Station in 5 minutes. Right next to the New City is a very nice park and also the Park Hyatt Hotel which is where the Narita Shuttle will drop you off and pick you up. The Park Hyatt is also well worth a visit for the bars and restaurants on the upper floors. The views of neon lit Shinjuku at night and Mount Fuji during the day are amazing. They do an Evening Tea deal which is about 拢20 a head for complimentary food and drink for two hours anytime between 5 and 9pm.All in all I would say that the New City represents fantastic value for money and is in a location which to my mind couldn't be bettered.

"great value for tokyo.... prime location! what a great deal for tokyo! rooms are considerably cheaper than anywhere else in the shinjuku area. sure, the rooms are kind of small, but i don't need a huge room. the front desk staff is very helpful and they even have a FREE shuttle bus from shinjuku station. GREAT place!  ",247

Excellent location near many small alley restaurants The hotel staff was excellent at being able to speak English and giving us directions and change without being condescending. The location was great with many small inexpensive restaurants nearby. We even went out on Sunday at 6 am and found quite a few choices for breakfast. Our package tour included the buffet so we did that every morning and the fruit and variety was much appreciated in the Western buffet. We never ate any other meals in the hotel because we were on an extreme budget but found many small restaurants in alleys closeby where we could eat for $10-20 each. We went to the corner convenience store to buy beer to drink in our room (although the vending machines on each floor dispense beer). One of our rooms was facing a building but our next room had a more sunny view on the other side of the annex building. It definitely felt like a neighborhood hotel with many foreign tourists which was great and not a glitzy fancy expensive hotel. The subways were a few blocks away and we walked to the Imperial Castle from the hotel. We also walked from Shinjuku down the Ometesando through Roppongi by the Tokyo Tower. The Narita bus dropped us off and picked us up very promptly. I would definitely stay at this hotel and in this neighborhood again. The accommodating staff and the location were the difference makers.  ,250
"good location for sightseeing pros:- central location in tokyo.- direct airport shuttle (Y3,000/one way).- good, professional staff, English proficient.- close to two subway stations.- clean.cons:- the room I was given had no environmental control; i.e. was either too cold or too hot.- limited and expensive internet access (two computers in the hallway: one of which was setup in japanese, 5 minutes/$1.- dated furniture and appearance (carpets, bed cover).- poor tv listing.  ",251
"Good location for daytime sightseeing LocationI stayed in the Shiba Park Hotel for one week of sightseeing. 3 subway lines and the Yamanote line can be reached in less than 10 minutes, so it's a great basis for daytime sightseeing. Tokyo World Trade Center (with it's gorgeous view over Tokyo Bay by night from the observation platform - don't miss it - and a Japanese Post office with international ATM) and Tokyo Tower can also be reached on foot. Ginza is just two subway stations away.BookingInitially I found the hotel on some hotel metasearch site, but the rates on the hotel's own (english language) website were about 10% better than the best alternative.RoomVery dated, probably should have been renovated 15 to 20 years ago (e.g. spots on the carpet, old furniture). However, cleaning personal is quite efficent. TV old, but three english speaking stations (CNNjapan, BBC World, CNBC). Empty minibar (which for me was a good thing, because the next convenience store is right next to the hotel and there are vending machines on each floor). Windows old, but hotel is located on a rather quite street without much car traffic.PersonalFriendly, efficent, english-speaking.SurroundingsMany small convenience stores, dozens of small restaurants, 24h-McDonald's, Starbucks, all in less than 5 min on foot. The next bigger food store with a good selection I found is one subway station away (1st floor of Shimbashi railway station). However not very much flashy nightlife (I didn't miss it, but that's just me).Who shouldn't book this hotel?If you want a modern and good looking room/hotel.If you want much nightlife, clubbing,..Who should consider booking this hotel?If you don't want to spend very much money on a good staging point for daytime exploration of Tokyo. For my needs the hotel was a very good choice.  ",252
"Great location, great staff You can get to the hotel from Narita Airport on the Hotel bus, its the last stop on the route and takes about 1 and 1/2 hours. We stayed at the Shiba Park Hotel on our arrival in Tokyo for 2 nights and on the very last night we were in Japan. Staying on 2 different occasions made us aware that some of the rooms have been recently refurbished and are very pleasant, whilst others, though clean enough are tired and a bit frazzled round the edges! The location is excellent, just a couple of minutes walk to Daimon tube station  5 minutes from Tokyo Tower. The staff all speak excellent English, and as we found was typical throughout Japan are extremely polite, professional and helpful. We didn't eat in the restaurant, Starbucks is a minutes walk away for breakfast and getting to restaurants in the evening is very simple via the tube. We did have a drink in the bar one night, which was lacking in atmosphere and also very expensive. If I was going back to Tokyo I would be quite happy to stay here again.  ",253
Not a bad deal...       room in annex 7th floor (the 11th floor ones are nicer)  ,254
"A Wonderful Stay at the Shiba Park Hotel Our family of five just returned from a wonderful trip to Japan (Tokyo and Kyoto). In Tokyo we stayed a total of nine nights at the Shiba Park Hotel. The staff there is very courteous and their english is very good. We had no problems at all with regards to communication. Services including safe deposit boxes and foreign currency exchange were right there, no need to go to a bank. The concierge desk was fully equipped to answer all of our questions, book tours, book transport to Narita Air[port as well as most other tourist needs. Bell staff were courteous, spoke good english and even refused a tip. Excellent marks to the staff.The rooms were large for Japan standards. We had a very large three bed room with a huge bath on the 12th floor of the annex. Our other room was a two bedroom unit on the 10th floor of the annex. It was also very large by Japanese standards for a two twin bed room. Each room had its own climate control as well as a TV with three english speaking channels (CNN, BBC and Bloomberg Financial). Japanese channels were also available. Very entertaining, even though we did not understand a word of what they were talking about! Pay channels were also available. Vending machines were available on most floors, though we found the convenience store at the end of the block to be less expensive and offer more selections.We ate breakfast every morning at the western cuisine coffee shop. It was a full hot/cold breakfast buffet. Very pricey, but similar to most all other Japanese hotels for a comparable breakfast, about $20/person. There is a Starbucks and McDonalds a short walk away. We ate dinner one night there after a late tour. Dinner was less expensive than breakfast! We didn't try any of the other restaurants in the hotel as they were pricey and there are several choices for meals of all kinds within a short walk.Location was very good. A three minute walk to Daimon subway station, five minute walk to Hammamatsucho (JR) train station. As you may know, there are always many restaurants near train stations.The overall appearance of the hotel is nice and clean. The hotel facilities are somewhat dated, but most fixtures are updated and fully functional.I highly recommend the Shiba Park Hotel.  ",255
"Excellent Choice for us! March 14th -19th This was our first visit to Tokyo ( couple in our mid sixties) so we chose this hotel based on the reviews here and for the ease of getting to it from the airport. We booked directly with the hotel from their website where they offered a promotional rate. We found it's location to be excellent for accessing the train/subway system and it was close to places to eat. The Zozoji Temple nearby made for a nice outing and we were able to walk to the Hinode Pier in about 20 minutes for the Sumida River Cruise.The check-in was quick and there was an ease of communication in English with the staff. They were also very helpful with the questions we had. The hotel has two buildings - we were in the annex in Room 1703 - you had to walk outside to access it. It was more of a business hotel than a resort type. The room was like the pictures on their website. It was compact but not cramped and had everything we needed. We appreciated the coffee/tea facility, the mini fridge and the internet access. Everything was clean and spotless. We availed of their breakfast buffet in the Primula Cafe on our first morning. It was excellent, but at 4600Y for 2 it was too expensive for us to repeat. McDonald's was a 5 minute walk away and there were several other places nearby to have dinner.Overall we would highly recommend the Shiba Park Hotel as a medium priced place to stay in Tokyo and would definitely return.  ",256
"There are better choices out there The stink emanating from the bathroom is the key reason I would not stay here again. The rooms were dingy and the location is ok, but not great. Our very expensive rooms did not include breakfast, which meant shelling out 2100 yen per person for a very average buffett!! Beds were lumpy, and room temp swung wildly between too hot and too cold. The only redeeming feature of this hotel was the excellent staff, all of whom spoke fluent English (important in a crisis), and all of whom were helpful above and beyond the call of duty. Nevertheless, the rooms smelled, and at these prices, that's not cool.  ",257
"A mixed bag Shiba Park Hotel is situated far from the madding crowd if you're looking for the heart of Tokyo. It is within walking distance of trains, Tokyo Tower and some shopping. Airport Limousine (coach) is direct from and to Narita Airport for Y3,000 each. Viator Tours are also direct to the door. Unfortunately the Airport Limousine has Shiba Park last on the drop off so that the hour trip from Narita became two and a quarter hours for two very jet-lagged guests. I also stayed here in 2001 and the experience then was much the same as now. The staff are very helpful and pleasant especially the three young people in charge of guest baggage. Reception is efficient. There were no problems in leaving baggage at the hotel during the day of departure while waiting for a flight as is the case in many European hotels. The room and bathroom were small but well maintained and very clean. We dined in the Japanese restaurant where the service was good but the food was in tiny,tiny portions that did not match the size of the bill. Breakfast each day (stayed 4 days) provided a good range of food that needs to be accessed as early as possible as by 08.00 it has been warming for too long. For non-smokers though these eateries are a blessing where one can breathe freely compared to restaurants throughout Japan where it is almost compulsory for all adult males to smoke at the table. Internet access available but you need your own laptop or pay a fee that is rather too high. My only real concern is the unpleasant aroma that pervades the street outside the hotel, from the sewer it seems, during the day and by mid afternoon has entered the lobby. This did not impact on either occasion on the rooms I have used .  ",258
"Very pleasant! :) We found the location very convenient as the hotel is close to the main bus station for tours and close to the train station which gives very easy access to all of Tokyo.The staff were impeccable, there was no language barrier problems (as the staff all spoke english) and staff were eager to help out with subway maps and had good suggestions for sightseeing.Although the hotel seems to be mainly catered to business clients we found it enjoyable as tourists on a four day stay.The room was clean and pleasant, with a vending machine (you can't escape them in Japan!) in the hall near the elevator. Convenient for water, coffee/tea's and other drinks without having to go to a shop outside the complex at 4am!All in all the stay at Shiba Park was very pleasant.:)  ",259
"Excellent - Highly recommended I have to be honest, brochures didn't give us a lot of hotels to choose from in Tokyo. As it was our first visit, I chose the Shiba Park after reading reviews on this site. We were not dissapointed - thanks to the staff and facilities at the Shiba Park. From the moment we arrived by shuttle from the airport, the staff went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. They were courtious and friendly, nothing being a bother. I would recommend this hotel to any english-speaking tourist visiting Tokyo for the first time - I can guarantee that they will want to go back for more...  ",260
"Best Hotel in Tokyo I found the hotel to be more then what i expected. it was located just a few blocks from the major train stations, which made it easy to travel around Japan.The staff went beyond the duties to accomodiate us on providing information about different places to visit around Tokyo.During our nine (9) day travel to Japan (traveling with my son and neice) we found the room to accomodiate us just right, there was convient space avaliable to unpack our bags and be able to relax and enjoy our visit.There are many restaurants and markets and stores within walking distance of the hotel. It gave us the ability to try different meals at reasonable prices. The japanese people are so polite in helping or directing you to their favor places of eatery.I would recommend this hotel to all my friends and every time we travel to Japan, we will stay at Shiba Park Hotel. One a scale of 1 to 10, Shiba Park Hotel rates above a 10 +++++.  ",261
"Super place! Have stayed at the Shiba Park Hotel 3 years running on stays in Tokyo.The good: The location is super convenient to 2 train lines and is also a stop on the limousine bus service straight out of Narita. The reception staff are always friendly and more than willing to help out! They even bring our huge snowboard and ski bags right up the room for us! The not so good: - Getting to Haneda airport isnt as easy as getting to/from Narita. The reception organised a hire mini van to take our crew to the airport which was cool though and wasnt much more expensive that a bus.- The beds are comfy and soft, but only though being well worn. If you like a hardish mattress, you may not have a good nights sleepI will always stay at the Shiba park. The price is spot on and the location is great.  ",262
"Good location, standard business hotel If I was to stay in an average hotel classified as business, Shiba Park is pretty much it.Once my friend and I arrived by shuttle, we were greeted by staff who were courteous and took the time to point out information on maps, etc.Room was bigger then we had expected, and the location is really quiet. Not in central area but had no problems travelling to the central areas via JR.Some of my favourite eat places turned out to be located close to the hotel, such as a Unagi eel place recommended by the hotel but only for the adventurous (food was fresh and delicious, we truly mingled with locals). Japanese food around this area worth trying.Facilites in our room such as bathroom were modern and clean.Only complaint was their so called business centre was two shoddy computers crammed in the lobby. Whenever I wanted to use the Internet, there were heaps of people from foreign school tours also wanting to use it. Also, computer rates not cheap, compared to most other Japanese hotels where Internet is free.For the price I paid, I would stay here again with a friend, or for business for a few days.  ",263
"Not to be recommended if you have a choice I was booked into this hotel by my company while staying in Tokyo on business. I was moved here from the Radisson because the Shiba Park is only a few minutes' walk from our office. In many ways I wish I had insisted on staying at the Radisson, and put up with the additional travel.The good points: the room was very clean with a comfortable bed. And that's about all.The bad points: although the reception area promises at least a reasonable experience, the room itself didn't live up to my expectations. It was very old fashioned and appeared to have been built perhaps in the 1970s and never refurbished since then. Everything about it said tired and old.This was a single room, but even so the bathroom was tiny, cheaply decorated and some of the fittings were in serious need of renewal.There was very little storage space: three small drawers and a fixture on the wall which was supposed to serve as a wardrobe; it is simply insufficient for a week's business stay anywhere in the world.I didn't use the hotel's restaurants. I did however take breakfast every day of my stay and that also left much to be desired. There was no fresh fruit at all, only the tinned variety in syrup offering a morning sugar overload. The coffee was rough and bitter. The choice of pastries was meagre and unreliable, i.e. different every day (perhaps that was a deliberate policy?)To summarise I would avoid this hotel if you can. There are much better ones in the area (as some of my colleagues know!)  ",264
"Good Location but Room Below Average... I have spend 2 nights there and in short:- rooms are indeed bigger than most other hotels in japan- no internet available in the room- bed is as hard as wood- the rooms cleanliness is well below average compared to what you usually get in Japan (stains on the wall, on the carpet etc...)- despite having asked for a non smoking room, I got a stinky room with yellow walls, I believe the only difference they make between smoking and non-smoking room is that they give you an ashtray or not...- I haven't tried the food, nor the breakfast, but there are anyway too many restaurants in the area to waste time in the hotel restaurants- the location is good, within walking distance of the Hamamatsu-cho JR Station next to the World Trade Center. You are also within walking distance of Ginza, with some very interesting bars...to conclude, I will personally never stay there again as I have seen much better hotels in Japan, and this one is definitely not worth the price you pay (15.000 JPY per night for a double bed room).  ",265
"Recpetion service very Un-Japanese My family  I stayed in this hotel back in Dec.06. Quite disappointed. The Reception service was horrible, very Un-Japanese. I've been to Japan on many occassions stayed at other hotels (other cities) during this trip, and was quite taken aback at the rudeness of the reception clerks. On a few occassions, we had asked questions regarding location and suggestions. One evening (male) clerk was impatient with our questions, and clearly did not try to hide his frustration or contempt in answering our typical tourist questions. The morning (male) clerk was not as rude, but was clearly not accomodating either. The 2 other female receptionists, were more professional--though lacking in Japanese hospitiality. Shiba Park is fairly close to the subway (JR), approx. 3 blocks or a 10 minute walk. This is the only selling point that the hotel has to offer. The hotel itself is quite old  dated. Don't be fooled by their website. One would guess that the owners have spent little on renovation. We stayed in the supposed newer building, and found the room to be of decent size. Then again, we had booked a room for 3 adults, so we were given a larger room. As for cleanliness, this hotel did pass. But I have yet to encounter a hotel that failed the cleanliness test in Japan. I would never stay in this hotel again, and would not recommend it to any travellers. The only reason I stayed, was because this was the only hotel that offered 3 person occupancy for a reasonable rate. Obviously, a bad choice on my part.  ",266
"Great Kimono's First time in Tokyo and very pleased with this hotel. On many reviews we'd read we knew that Tokyo hotel rooms were smaller than than most other places and that was indeed the case here, but it more than had everything we needed including funky kimono's in the room to wear after a shower.The location of the hotel was ideal for exploring as near to underground station which is only a few stops from the centre and within easy walking distance to the Tokyo Tower.The staff were also top notch, very friendly and more than helpful. Would definitely stop here again if returning to Tokyo.  ",267
"Satisfied with our stay Like other posters have noted, we found the decor in our room very dated. We made fun of the fact that a console figured prominently in our lives, but we loved that that console had conveniently placed bedside light dimmer knobs. There were three of us and the room had three single beds, pleasantly firm mattresses, comfortable pillows, extra blankets. Our corner room was totally dark at night (and in fact could have used better lighting by day), totally quiet, and truly smoke-free. It was a basic western bathroom with good water pressure in the shower. The room was small but not tiny; we would have liked more drawers but had a full closet and we did not feel cramped.Maid service was great. Service in general was quite helpful - moreso than most American hotels - but to some degree I suppose that is a Japanese thing. I did send an e-mail query before our stay that went unanswered. The concierge desk was pretty helpful about making phone calls and printing out maps. The cocktail lounge in the annex was quite nice and while pricy had a half-price happy hour from 5 to 7 daily. Good live jazz combo Friday nights.The neighborhood seemed a little boring but the hotel was located near three key train lines. There were restaurants around if we needed them, and a convenience store.  ",268
"A good hotel We stayed in this hotel for 4 days and found it to be very satisfactory. It is in a good central location without being noisy. The staff were very friendly and helpful. While the decor is a little dated, the rooms are of a good size and well appointed, and certainly good value for money. The only gripe I would have is that the food in the restaurants was a bit average for the price, but as far as the room itself was concerned, it was perfectly adequate.I would happily stay at this hotel again next time I am in Tokyo.  ",269
"Would stay again if in Tokyo as first choice My wife and I stayed at Shiba Park for 7 nights in April 2006. We found the facilities and service excellent. The staff on the front desk have very good English and the lady on the information desk went out of her way to help plan trips etc. There is also a Customer Relations Manager who is very willing to resolve any issues that may arise. No experience of the restaurants apart from the Primula Coffee Shop which serves a good buffet breakfast to set you up for the day.Tony Mayston,Buckingham,England  ",270
"Nothing special but good location Stayed for 3 nights. Hotel was clean but nothing special, seemed old fashioned compared to other hotels I've stayed in. Didn't eat in the restaurants. Location wise, not far from train stations, and also within walking distance of Tokyo Tower and Hinode Pier (useful for taking boat trip to other parts of the city). Upon arrival, I thought it was not in a particularly good location but having managed to reach everywhere I wanted very easily and not having been disturbed by noisy roads etc, I would recommend it.  ",271
"Nice and comfortable For my first trip tp Tokyo, I stayed here with no problems. The room and bathroom were a good size and the tv had at least one English channel, although Japanese game shows are more entertaining than CNN. Check out the toilet with seat warming and cleaning functions. Breakfast was standard tea, coffee, OJ, toast with jam and selected pastries. Nothing special, but it started you up for the day. The staff were friendly and accommdating. The hotel is conveniently located near JR Hamamatsucho station (about 10-15 mins walk). The Onarimon and Daimon stations are located nearer, but I used Hamamatsucho all the time as it does the city circle run (Tokyo, Harajuku, Shibuya, Shinjuke etc). The Tokyo Tower is also about a 10-15 mins away.The Shiba park Hotel may not be the flashiest or best looking, but it was convenient, clean and comfortable.  ",272
"Watch out, they're hot I booked at the Shiba Park Hotel, then due to circumstances beyond my control, I had to cancel  the cancellation fee was 100% !!Now that's hot!  ",273

"Great little hotel in Tokyo, great location !! A perfect starter hotel for Tokyo!The Shiba Park hotel is in a great little location. Sure, it's better to be right in the middle of Ginza but you don't want to pay a fortune every time. And if it's your first trip to Tokyo, why spend a fortune when you don't know your way around and don't know where you want to stay.(The different parts of Tokyo are wildly different. Many famous hotels, notably say the Park Hyatt, are in what to me are totally rubbish, unusable, locations.)There are all sorts of interesting things to walk to from the door of thr Shiba Park (say, the Tokyo Tower .. sort of like the Eiffel Tower! .. excelllent gardens, a temple, etc) and it's an easy longer walk or ride to Ginza and all the rest of Tokyo.There are any number of little noodle shops and the like at hand, and yes a McDonalds for the kids just around the block!MOST IMPORTANTLY it is very easy to get to and from Narita, to the Shiba Park ... just figure out the bus which goes to and from Narita, to the Shiba Park front door (it also goes to certain other hotels on a loop).This is far and away -- USUALLY -- your best way to get to and from the airport to this particular hotel anyway. Certainly from the hotel back to the airport, take that bus.Coming from the Airport, you may want to take the train (go in to the basement of the airport and easily find the train - but you have to buy the train ticket upstairs before you go down! heh!) to Tokyo Station - then just get a taxi to Shiba Park Hotel please.The hotel is a little older - not really run down but just a bit older. It's kind of how you'd think of a really really good motel in the USA, say. Room sizes are acceptable-to-good. If you have kids, definitely get the largest room you can possibly afford (but that's true of any hotel in Tokyo).(Tokyo hotel rooms are not ABSOLUTELY LAUGHABLY MINISCULE like Parisian hotel rooms, but they are a bit small sometimes!)Like many Tokyo hotels it rather sprawls over a couple of annexes .. we have stayed in both the front and rear building and both are much the same. I've stayed here on my own, with the family (small children) etc and it has been plenty of fun in all cases. It's kind of a 6 or so story building .. which is nice, it's not like staying in a megahotel. Sort of a neighborhood hotel, it feels like.Value is good-to-OK, just try to get a good room rate. If you get a good rate, you're totally set, it's a great deal. The staff are 100% nice and truly kind, but that's basically true of all Japanese hotels (and all Japanese people!) They always love our two small girls, it's great.Really, if you're not staying at a top hotel, you'll find it hard to beat the Shiba Park or somewhere very like it (I can't think of anywhere just like it).The Shiba is DEFINITELY MUCH BETTER than most other hotels in the same price category ... many of the hotels in the category are in those weird Tokyo locations, like say a building stuck over an elevated railway or something in the middle of a 100% business district where you find yourself wondering why the heck you booked that hotel!Again if you have not been to Tokyo before and you just find it mystifying (and why wouldn't you -- the ---- maps are printed sideways! :) ) you definitely won't go wrong at the Shiba Park, the perfect starter hotel for Tokyo.During one stay ... a beautiful, indeed magical, Japanese traditional wedding party was leaving from the lane in the middle of the hotel. We and all the other guests stopped and watched...very beautiful!  ",275
"Quiet, friendly, clean! Would stay again anytime! We stayed at the Shiba Park Hotel for the first 4 nights of our honeymoon in August 2003. It was our 鈥渓anding hotel鈥?where we could get adjusted to jet lag and weather. The hotel was absolutely perfect for this purpose. We were very pleased with it, and would absolutely consider going again. I got an excellent rate on Expedia 鈥?they seem to have an ongoing relationship.The neighborhood is wonderful. It is very quiet and easy to find from the nearby Yamanote stop (Hamamatsucho). The hotel is nestled in among quiet residential streets, and is within walking distance of a large shrine and cemetery (Zojoji) for a famous Japanese shogunate family (I forgot which one.) Since we were up at 5 am, it was fun to go explore our neighborhood in peace and quiet.We did have drinks down in the bar 鈥淭he Fifteens鈥?one night. I got a kick out of it 鈥?it reminded me of a classic 1950鈥檚 American lounge, with a waiter in a tux vest and everything. Not a bit Japanese but very nice. They had great western beers (for me) and whiskeys (for my husband.) The restaurants looked very nice, however, we were on a crazy schedule and ended up eating a lot of noodles and izakaya food instead (there鈥檚 an izakaya on the street that runs between the Hamamatsucho station and the hotel 鈥?perfect!The only problem we had here 鈥?as we had throughout the entirety of our stay, is that we were placed in a room with two double beds (standard twin). For our honeymoon! This happened constantly in Japan, so I assume it鈥檚 more common than a king-sized bed. Other than the beds, our room was relatively spacious (by Japanese standards) and VERY quiet. We slumbered like cats. The room was also very clean and comfortable, with AC that we used a lot in the August heat.I speak very broken Japanese and my husband speaks none, however the desk staff was multilingual and this was not a problem. I got a far better exchange rate at the hotel than at Narita, FYI.  ",276
"Great Location, Good Value The hotel appears to be a little old and tired and could do with a modern refurbishment, however the rooms were always kept neat and tidy by the housekeeping staff. No complaints with the service - as always in Japan the staff are very courteous and are always willing to help. The breakfast was very pleasant.The location of the hotel is a plus - 5 minutes walk to the nearest JR station and a stones throw from some nice Tokyo sites. I would consider staying at this hotel again in the future for my leisure travels.  ",277
"clean tidy good location This is a very good mid priced hotel. Well appointed rooms and adequate light breakfast. Close to both daimon and shiba-koen subway stations (both about 500mtrs). Tokyo tower approx 250mtrs, Roppongi nightlife centre straight on 250mtrs. Centre of Tokyo approx 3 kms. If travelling south to Mt Fuji, Hakoni area check local subway stations for connections instead of going into Tokyo station you save heaps if using the shinkansen.  ",278

We had a quiet spacious room at the back with a window and shutters that were rusting and hard to open and close,Bedroom and bathroom were clean but in desperate need of decoration.Electric sockets were dodgy and bathroom was tiny with mildew around the ancient shower fittings.Main problem were the fleas that we could see jumping over the slightly damp sheets and feasted on us during the night!The madam at breakfast was very rude when we appeared 10 minutes before breakfast was due to finish and told us off for being so late.Where was the customer service?Location was central and the city's beauty upliflted our spirits on leaving the hotel each morning.  ",288
"Repeat perfprmance... The hotel has always been accommodating. Questions or needs are taken care of at any hour. The rooms are a good size and the location so central, I have always felt comfortable and continue to count on the hotel on my visits to Florence.  ",289
"Disappointing We were very disappointed with our stay here. We wanted a hotel close to the railway station, and a travel agent recommended the Basilea to us. Location-wise it was okay, but in the end we were glad we were only there for two nights. The room was small and smelly, the wallpaper was peeling from the walls, the bathroom was tiny and didn't even have a toilet paper holder. The towels stank of vinegar, and the hair dryer was rubbish - I could have dried my hair better with a fan. In the hallway, the ceiling was beginning to cave in in some places, revealing some of the electronics above. Shabby. The breakfast was mediocre, and the breakfast staff unhelpful. On top of that, the reception staff we experienced were rather arrogant. If you're just looking for a place to sleep on a budget and don't care about smelly rooms and mediocre service, then I suppose it's okay. But this is definitely not a 3-star hotel.  ",290
"Great place to stay We stayed in a nearby hostel for one night and had such a terrible night sleep due to other noisy guests playing music and talking loudly late into the night. We immediately packed our bags in the morning and found this hotel. The staff were so welcoming, kind, and respectful. The room was perfectly air conditioned, quiet, and comfortable. The breakfast was included in the price of the room and was served in a beautiful room and was also a great meal. The reception at the hotel also booked a reservation for us at the Uffizi where we skipped the queue, which was over an hour long.  ",291
"Lovely staff, the rest left much to be desired.... We booked two nights at this hotel and were very disappointed. First I would like to say that the lady that greeted us at the desk was absolutely lovely. She was so helpful and very kind and I couldn't have asked for better reception.We were disappointed with the location and the cleanliness of the rooms. The location is less than desirable and not a good location to bring children.There is no water pressure and the blow dryer is completely inadequate. When my friend went to take a shower, there was hair in the shower from the previous guests.We left the hotel the next morning to go on a day trip and upon our return, there were still dirty dishes, dirty towels in the bathroom. It was on the day trip that I learned about the hair in the shower and we called and booked another hotel to stay at. We left this hotel early, even though I had to pay the entire stay (per policy..could not argue that..it was only right) but we were happy to stay elsewhere.Frankly, I'm surprised this is in Rick Steve's book as he had not led us wrong before this hotel.It is ok if you are on a tight budget and again, the staff is very very helpful.  ",292
"Hotel Basilea - Disgusting We booked the Hotel Basilea based on Rick Steve's Italy 2007 book. He classifed it as a typical 3-star hotel. Oh my, does he have some things to learn about what a 3-star hotel is. First the lift would only hold one person and one suite case. Once we entered the room, which had a very musty smell I could not believe my eyes. The room was exceptionally small - as I started to look around the room I saw ripped/torn wallpaper, dirty walls, heavily soiled carpets and chair. We had booked for 3 nights and I told my husband (through my tears) that I did not know how I could spend 3 nights in the room - it made my skin crawl. I went to the bathroom to get a tissue to find the floor filthty with remands of the previous guests - the towels from the previous guest had not been changed - their dirty towels still hung on the towel bar and the trash from their stay was still in the trash can. My husband immediately went out to find someone to help. While he was out all I could do was sit on the edge of the bed and cry. I decided to check the bedding and when I pulled backed the pillow case I saw tiny spots of blood from the bed bugs. Fortunately my husband found a travel agent two doors from the hotel who was able to book us into the Grand Hotel Baglioni (which turned out to be a 10 in our book-highly recommend). The travel agent called us a cab to take us there. In all of our travels, and we travel a lot, I have never been in a place so thoroughly disgusting.  ",293
good choice... We stayed here only for a night but its really beautiful...the room is clean and everything is nice most especially the staffs whose working here...they will really entertain you very well...This is really a good choice and Im very much willing to recommend this to all those who are looking for somewhere to stay regarding the fact that is has also reasonable/affordable price...  ,294
"I loved it! I stayed in this hotel when I went with EF Tours my senior year of high school. I loved this hotel! It was one of the best that we stayed in! I found the service great and the fact that you could walk from the hotel to anywhere was an added plus, since that was one of the few places that we were allowed to have free time. I thought that breaksfast was really good and the few that we had from where we ate breakfast was fantastic! I hope to stay there again in the future.  ",295
"Tiny rooms expensive rooms  There was a mix up with my reservation at this hotel. I called several times from California to ensure I'd have a room for 2 nights. The hotel was only able to accomodate me for 1 night but said would try hard for a 2nd night. Since I never got a response I booked 1 night with their sister Hotel Ritz, Florence. When I identified myself and asked the hotel's front attendant if there was a vacancy, he (without checking) rudely said NO! to any possible vacancies. I left Hotel Basilea to Hotel Ritz only to find out Hotel Ritz cancelled my reservation because they claimed a person who was to check out the day I was to have this room, had gotten sick and the hotel couldn't give me this room. This sounded like a like lies. The Hotel Ritz sent me to another hotel so I had to take my luggage away to start all over again when I did have a confirmation of this reservation at the Hotel Ritz. Based on this bad experience I will never stay at Hotel Basilea/Hotel Ritz if I visit Florence in the future. I write this review only to help other travelers who visit Italy for 1st. time. and don't know.  ",296
"I was not disappointed I was booked into the hotel for a stay of almost two weeks (early March 2007, off season), and arrived with low expectations due to some of the comments on Tripadvisor. My own opinion is that this hotel represents a good value in Florence if you book a room for around 75 euros a night (or less) for a double in the off season and about 100-110 in high. If the price increases beyond that (and the inclusion of this and its sister hotels in various guides may cause that) the value and one's expectations obviously start changing proportionately. Does the wallpaper need replacing? Yes. Are true nonsmoking rooms rare in Italy? Yes. Is this the Ritz or even a Hampton Inn? No. It is a European budget hotel doing a better job than most, in my opinion. One should not expect a modern room, but the furniture is respectable, the beds were firm, the wardrobe was large, and there was a desk. I had the largest double room that I have ever had in anything less than a four star hotel in Europe. I never heard anyone walking above me-- I have no idea if the room was occupied during my stay or not but my guess is the floors are thick. If the people in the room next door are loud you will hear them but that is true of most hotels. The hotel is a five block walk from the train station straight down Via Nazionale then a half block (turn right) on via Guelph. Don't use the station's underground walkway if you have luggage because there are no escalators at the stairways at the other ends. If you take a cab instead it is a straight shot for the cab and should not cost more than 8 euros, probably less, and most of the cost will be the supplement for your luggage (that is what it cost me going the other way which is not a straight shot). The breakfast consists of a coffee bar, fresh croissants and rolls, cereals, fresh fruit and fruit juices, sliced ham and cheese. If you want eggs, a bar half a block away on the corner of Via Nazionale has them for 3 euros. Via Guelph has most of what you need---internet spots (several, including Internet Train, within three blocks with access as low as 2 euros an hour, along with copying machines, faxes, etc) restaurants (the pizzaria on the corner of the next block has a full menu and is good, reasonable, and friendly--a good sized plate of spaghetti carbonara for 8 euros), food stores, bakery, etc. You are within several blocks of the Mercato Centrale (big indoor food market with stalls) and the San Lorenzo Market shopping stalls and there are some additional, excellent restaurants in that area (try the very popular Za-Za, or Flexo next door, both on the Piazza Mercato Centrale. The former may require reservations. An excellent fillet in chianti sauce can be had at the latter for 16 euros. Avoid Cellini which is right nearby as well). The cathedral is 10 minutes walk; the Uffizi is 15. The Accademia and San Marco are five minutes away. I took a cab one day from a spot near the Arno up to the hotel and it cost about 11 euros in late afternoon, if your group wants to skip the walk back after a full day. The area around the hotel is not dangerous but it is not a high-priced tourist neighborhood either. Florence is a vibrant city with a diverse population and that is reflected in this neighborhood. I was a woman alone for six of my days there and I never felt endangered. I found the hotel staff friendly enough (one night desk clerk is a bit stiff) and very helpful, the old imac in the lobby worked when I used it, and my room was not dirty (although the wallpaper, as noted, was dingy). The shower worked fine once I realized that the pressure tended to weaken after the first few minutes. I just had to turn the nob more when it did and that fixed it for that shower. Even with a fairly full hotel they never ran out of hot water while I was there. The shower was very small which is common in European budget hotels from my experience. (A friend was in room 106 and it had a very odd bath/shower combination with restrictive doors. It should be avoided by all but the agile, the young, and the svelte.) There are large rooms with three or four beds available that families or groups of friends will find very economical. I saw one of the four bed rooms and while it had a dormitory feel with the beds lined up closely, it was large enough even with the beds to move around comfortably. Those rooms are sometimes used by groups of students (and professors) for study visits, and it appears that they usually stay on the first floor. If you are concerned about the chance for noise (two such groups were there during my stay and were quiet by 10) ask to be put far away from any such groups. The rooms with balconies look out on nothing special---rooftops and the balconies of surrounding apartments (see photos with other reviews) although I met a couple who had a balcony on the end of the second floor with a view of the cathedral dome. Rooms facing the back will be quieter than those on the street, but the street quiets down a lot in the evening and is not a major traffic route at any time. The balconies are large (I had one) and come with table and chairs, but have the usual drawback that you hear the people on the one next to you and if they are loud that can be a problem. The balcony rooms have french doors instead of a window. Closing the window and shutters cut down on outside noise significantly. I was in room 118. 117 would be preferable because it is not next to the clatter of the breakfast room like 118 is. 116 seems to be the room in the website pictures that has the wrought iron terrace/balcony. I cannot speak to the air-conditioning since it was not hot weather while I was there but the heat seemed fine. If your refridgerator is not working ask them to make sure it is plugged in (it probably isn't) and then give it a few hours to cool down. The rooms come with hair dryers and also packets of shampoo, and other amenities like shower caps. They will do your laundry if you want--- drop off at the front desk by 9 a.m. and it comes back in the early evening, or you can save money and use either the drop off laundry or the self service one, both within a block or so. This hotel wasn't fancy but it was much nicer than I expected and comfortable and convenient. I would stay here again. Hint on Florence: definitely look into the reservation system for entering the Uffizi and the Accadamia. In high season especially you will be glad you did.  ",297
Close to Train Station       Duomo  ,298
"Roof over you head, nothing more Thank goodness our stay in Florence was only 2 nights otherwise we would have definitely found somewhere else.The front desk attendants were as pleasant as they need to be. Our biggest gripe is that the room (#208) was just plain old dirty. Think our initial reaction upon entering was, eewww gross. Stains on the walls, dingy, and grungy. The wallpaper is in need of serious replacement. We booked it on the recommendation of Rick Steve's book, and thought about changing the booking after reading reviews here but didn't, that is a regret. Hotel would be better off ripping the wallpaper off of the walls and painting to help make maintenance and cleaning easier and a higher priority! At least the place was relatively inexpensive @ 110 euros / night.  ",299
"smelly We just returned from 2 weeks in Italy, which included 3 days and 2 nights in Florence.  We used Rick Steve's Italy 2006 book to plan our trip. He recommended this hotel in the book. It's not in a great location, although it's close to the train station. About a 10 to 15 minute brisk walk to the center of town.  The room smelled of stale cigarettes. We requested a non-smoking room which they confirmed, but after our arrival and check-in the hotel claimed that they can't prevent people from smoking in the rooms. There were about 6-7 ash trays in this tiny room! Yuck. Anyway, that's all they had, so that's what we got. The water in the shower either scalded you or froze you, and all within a split second. Showering was an adventure! Maybe one positive is that it was quiet even though it's on a mian street.  Everything in Florence is soooo close, so being near the train station is not important.  Again, I would not recommend this place.  ",300
Almost reasonable       Dining Room  ,301
"Terrible Hotel, it should be 1 or 2 stars!!!! Avoid this hotel if you can. It is not clean, rooms are very old. Every time you walk the floor squeekes terribly. The surrounding area is not what I would call safe, it is weird...Breakfast is limited and definetly not a 3 star one!!I do not recommend this Hotel believe me.  ",302
"Good value in an ideal location. I stayed here in August 06 and this was probably the best value for money Hotel that I鈥檝e stayed in, in Italy. The staff were extremely helpful, the location couldn鈥檛 have been any better, you could see the Duomo from the bedroom window and could walk almost anywhere. The room was large, the shower / toilet was clean and adequate. The beds / towels are changed daily, the air-conditioning although slightly noisy did what it was meant to do and kept the room at the temperature at which it was set. The breakfast was ideal, with a never-ending supply of fresh orange, tea, coffee etc. The hotel is down a side street just off a busy main road but even with the windows open, you would have to struggle to hear any noise from it. The lift could take four people (of UK size). The computer in the reception area did have a slightly sticky keyboard, but hey it鈥檚 for holiday use and it鈥檚 free 24 / 7. I arrived by plane so I didn鈥檛 have any trouble parking. There is a good selection or caf茅s / restaurants near by (although I would advise that you avoid the Fish Bar). I disagree with most of the other reviews. This is a good quality three-star hotel, which I would certainly return to.  ",303
"Comfortable and Reasonable       Our bathroom, just like every other bathroom in Europe  ",304
"A dump! This place was a dump. So incredibly noisy (even with the windows closed) that we could not sleep. We cut our trip short by three days to get out of here. The staff was extremely rude. The toilet was situated in such a way that your legs were literally tucked under the sink (you had to sit sideways). It smelled of urine. The air conditioning worked poorly (and since you couldn't open the windows) it was suffocating. It is in a rundown, kind of seedy part of town. The only good thing is that it is around the corner from the laundromat and the trattoria across the street is excellent. I would not recommend this to anyone. It was the low point of a one month trip throughout Italy.  ",305
"Reasonable! We (family of five, young children) stayed at this hotel last year for a night. Overall, it wasn't bad at all. I was actually surprised to see the rather poor comments about it on TripAdvisor. Yes, the hotel is old, the rooms are not very big,...But what else is news in Europe (Italy, in particular) at a budget?!We found the staff extremely helpful. The breakfast (included) was good. The elevator was small but hey! it worked!The location was great. Biggest problem: no parking. In fact, as mentioned by another traveller, you have to unload your luggage, and then have the car parked by the valet. However, I didn't find the price of the parking and valet so terrible. I can't recall the exact amount but I remember it was reasonable. In fact, the compulsory valet was perhaps a blessing in disguise as I didn't have to go searching, etc.... took a nice warm bath instead and enjoyed it!!Well, again, don't expect a dazzling six-star hotel, but I certainly disagree with most of the negative comments about this hotel. Overall, it's OK I'd say!  ",306
"Old Word Charm, minus the Charm The bathroom had black tiles and the water in the shower vacillated between scalding and freezing constantly. The coffee in the restaurant was probably the worst coffee in Italy. It was quite warm when we were there in late April, and they don't turn on the air conditioners until June, so we had the window open, however, the street noise was so deafening, we had to sleep with earplugs in. The staff people were not super helpful. The ancient iMac in the lobby for free Internet access did not work much of the time and the keyboard was sticky. When the fake flowers on the breakfast table droop, it's time to renovate.  ",307
"You can hear your neighbors brushing their teeth! This hotel, as mentioned in previous reviews, is in quite a good location. They charge a fair amount for valet car parking, so do try to find a parking garage yourself (there are a few just around the corner)The room was clean and the staff exceptionally friendly  professional, but that's where the positives end.Firstly- the walls are PAPER THIN. We heard people's tv's, conversations, brushing of teeth, and finally we heard someone throwing up their guts the next morning- lovely.Secondly- it is a very old hotel in major need of some updatingThirdly- that foul smell in the lobby is still lurking, whatever it may be! Awful.I would not recommend anyone to this hotel. Its a shame, though, as the staff are great.  ",308
"Very good service, good rates, great location The staff was excellent for planning my stay. They booked all mueums and suggested great inexpensive trattoria.The Room was nice. Great location for walking to museums.  ",309
"Avoid this place We stayed at the Hotel Basilea in October 2004 on the basis of a favorable review in the Rick Steves guidebook. At his suggestion, I booked a room on the backside of the hotel away from the street. This turned out to be a big mistake. The back of the hotel faces a courtyard and the noise from the neighboring apartment buildings (which were extremely close to our window) kept us awake almost all of the night. We shut the window, but this did little good. Also, there was a great deal of noise from the other guests in the hotel. Apparently, this place attracts drunken revelers who enjoy congregating in the hall and noisily recounting their bar-hopping exploits in the wee hours. I asked them to keep it down, but it did no good. Our room also was very small and the air conditioning was not working. There was no bathtub (only a shower). The breakfast buffet is a little limited and the quality of the food is average at best. On the basis of this experience and a similar experience at another hotel in Rome, I would recommend not taking guidebook recommendations at face value.  ",310
"During the blackout We stayed here two nights in September. Location is close to the station if you exit the station on the right side. The country-wide black-out hit during our first night. We slept through most of it. The staff managed to feed us breakfast by candle-light and even had hot coffee and milk for latte! Alas, no cappachino. We found the room nice enough, didn't notice any noise. We've come to appreciate bath tubs to soak away tourist aches and pains. They have tubs. The terrace was not in use. We'd stay there again probably. Their internet service is bogus, we found an internet cafe nearby and did our email for a couple of bucks. A tiny elevator will take your bags up, but we didn't use it otherwise.  ",311
"Stay Away I chose the Hotel Basilea from a review in the Rick Steve's book. I'm not sure when he last stayed at this hotel, but I find that I cannot recommend it. The locationis fairly convenient. However, street noise that he mentions is the least of the hotel's problems. I had a room far removed from the street. The noise problem stems from an absolute lack of soundproofing between rooms. You hear EVERY noise from all adjoining rooms. If you are a single traveler, you should especially stay away from this place. The single room is less than six feet across (I measured). Since most travelers need their hotels rooms primarily for sleep and not for absolute comfort, the noise problems here simply don't fit the bill.  ",312

"Very Disappointed! My fianc茅 and I are extremely disappointed in this hotel. First of all, we went the same weekend as a Dallas Cowboy football game and were surprised that it was not staffed properly for that weekend. There was a very long wait to check-in to our room, and the front desk was very crowded and disorganized. The bar was a crazy mess, completely disorganized and dysfunctional there was a 20 minute wait for drink, we did take into mind that it was a game weekend but still no excuse. Second, when we called the hotel several weeks prior to check-in, the hotel staff told us that they had a free shuttle to and from Texas Stadium (which is one of the reason why we booked). When we got to the hotel they alerted us that it would be $12 per person for the shuttle to and from the stadium (cheaper to take a cab). To top it off, there was construction going on at the hotel and we woke up in the morning to the sounds of hammering and drills. With no warning!! And most importantly, on the day that we left the hotel, we had the hotel bell desk hold our luggage so that we could get some breakfast before heading to the airport. When we got back to the hotel to get our luggage, the staff had sent our luggage with someone else to the airport. Talk about a shocker, I got so nervous thinking we would never see our suitcase with the contents again. However, they retuned the luggage after about 30 minutes. But with no remorse, not even a simply 鈥渟orry, our mistake鈥? The shuttle driver that drove us to the airport was more apologetic then the manager who told us about our missing luggage. Too bad, the hotel itself was nice enough for us to stay again but this experience and the hotel staff and the way they function completely ruined it for us.  ",332
not bad was staying here as part of a sports tour for the cowboys game and for the stars game at the aa arena. The pickup from the airport was ok and very quick and they also took you for free for a 3 mile radius and that included Texas stadium and also to the TRE station. On game day there is a charge for them taking you to the game and back. and this starts 3 hours before the game and upto 2 hours afterwards. (when asked about next year at the new stadium they advised that it is being looked into). They advised that there were renovations going on but was not distubed by them and i left the air con on during the day and didnt need it overnight. Staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was excellant. There are 30 resurants in the area as well as a couple of gentlemen clubs and a number of asian massage places. You really need a car to get around or a good knowledge of the local transport system. I used the TRE to go downtown and also out to the Stockyards at Fort worth. Beds were comfortable and there was a good supply of different pillows to use. Walls i found were no more thinner then any other hotel.  ,333
"More bad than good Check in was great.Shuttle service is great except on weekends when they ususally have college teams stay here and then al lthe attention goes to groups and not family nor individual travelers.There is availability of adult programming on the TVs, but don't weaste your money. The walls are very thin so you can hear EVERYTHING!!!! I mean, you can almost see the couple in the next room doing it. Man, something really wild was going on, I thnk I even heard a dog bark...It can be very entertaining. :)In the AM... (Let me tell you that I am a sound sleeper) Even though I was very tired, I could not sleep past 7AM. Noise coming in form everywjhere...people leaving, doors slamming, vacuum cleaners and people talking. It was unbelievably clear as if they all were next to my bed.Ac in the room is very noisy... I think the same is in all rooms. You set the ac to your desired temp, but about every 15 minutes it will run into gear loudly for 5 minutes... Then you will have that 4 times per hour throughout the night. It should be fine if you are not going to be in the room that much or you don't plan to sleep at all. :)Good things: Coffe makerHOUSEKEEPING IS SUPERB!!! NICE PEOPLE AND VERY ATTENTIVE. great soap, work desk and fridge in room, comfortable beds, shuttle services Mon-Thursday.Not much to do around the hotel unless you have a car.  ",334
"Not bad The purpose of our trip was to go to the Dallas Cowboys game (Vs. Eagles, Monday night game)...Pros:- Free shuttle service to/from airport, free shuttle anywhere within 5-mile radius is free - bed  pillows were comfortable- free happy hour from 5PM - 6:30PM- free breakfast buffet (good variety)- bathroom goodies are from Bath  Body works (smell good) - clean hotel overall- friendly staff- enjoyable experience Cons:- A/C is very loud, its a unit next to the window it goes on and off every few seconds, its annoying- there's not much to do in the area, only chain restaurants, 1 nudity bar and couple clubs that look pretty boringIf we were to go back, we would most likely stay for 1 night meaning fly in, go to the game, sleep at hotel and fly out next morning back home. We went Downtown where the aquarium is located, not much there, reataurants and a couple stores. The shuttle also took us to World Trade center although since we are not vendors we can't shop there, its only for vendors and you buy things in bulk. Perhaps since we didn't have our own car we didn't get to see/do much, maybe that would have made a difference, I can't believe that there is not much to do in Dallas, its a big town..Maybe next time.  ",335
"Being renovated; not horrible You can probably discount the really negative reviews from 2007, as the Elegante is under new management and is being renovated in mid-2008. The hotel isn't great, but it's not terrible either. The A/Cs are on the wall, not central, so they're rather loud, but the rooms are clean, with good free Internet (about 1700 kbps, not fast, but faster than most U.S. hotels I've been in lately). Clean, carpet, decent decor, small refrigerator and microwave oven. Clean, new bedding and reasonably comfortable beds.This part of Dallas is full of cheap chain restaurants. Not pretty, but convenient to DFW if, like me, you're stuck in bad weather (summer lightning thunderstorms) and having to spend an extra unplanned night in Dallas. The hotel was good about sending shuttles to DFW to pick up folks, and scheduling them back to the airport the next day for another try at getting the heck out of town.There are many, many better hotels in Dallas, but I'd say this one is better than 'average' if you consider the full range of places people could stay.Pool (which I haven't seen yet) is only open until 11 (though that's typical). Weight room is open all night. Food closes at 10, I believe, though there are lots of places nearby.  ",336
"There's better places to stay in Dallas. I stayed at this hotel for a long business trip. First I will say that the staff was very friendly. I was picked up at DFW in a reasonable time and check in went smooth. The room itself was clean and the bed was comfortable, but that was about it. The property is in need of an update. The building is a drab brown color and the hallway floor outside of my room was very dirty as the carpet had not been cleaned in some time and was beginning to pull up. The ice machines did not work on at least 3 of the floors. The outdoor pool was a mess. There was some sand in the pool from the construction on the property. Their way of cleaning the sand was taking a squeegee and sweeping down the pool stairs to the bottom of the pool and leaving it there. I am not kidding as I watched this from my room. Most of the pool chairs were broken and several tiles from inside of the pool were missing. All in all, I would not be back to this property. There are so many more places to stay in Dallas, why spend your money here.  ",337
"Excellent Hotel / Loved the location Having stayed in this hotel under previous ownership, I can say that the renovations are incredible. The rooms are spacious and the beds comfortable. The customer service was GREAT!! My husband would have been impressed by the granite Ten Commandments in front of the hotel! I travel to Dallas on business a couple of times a year and would stay at this hotel again. This is the first time that have ever left the hotel to look around the area. There are restaurants and fast food places within walking distance. Just wear comfy shoes!  ",338
"What a surprise! This hotel is 100% better than when it was the Radisson Hotel  Suites. Since taken over in August 2007, ALL the rooms have new beds and furniture. The lobby furniture is all new and the carpert has been replaced throughout. The bar is reopened after being closed for complete renovation. It looks great and the staff is so friendly.You cannot beat the location with so many restaurants and entertainment just outside the front door. The complimentary airport transportation alone makes this a great value. I will be staying here again on my next trip to Dallas.Carl  ",339
"Excellent After a long trip from Scotland we had the pleasure of staying at the Elegante. The staff were first class  the room spotless, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We read previous reviews before we left, which gave us concern but these proved to be completely unfounded.  ",340
"Unbelievable Service I have never received service like I received at the Elegante during my four night stay. The staff bent over backwards to ensure that I had everything that I needed. We were in the lobby on our way to dinner and were trying to figure out how to get to the restaurant. An employee saw us struggling with directions and took us to the computer where he printed out the route. He advised us of construction and gave a way to avoid it. I noticed that he wasn't dressed like the rest of the staff and asked what he did at the hotel...he was one of the MAINTENANCE workers. I stayed at the Omni two weeks before and couldn't get anyone at the front desk to help.The MCM is an average hotel, clean, quiet with nice rooms. The area was a bit concerning, but I would definitely stay at the hotel again, for the staff alone.  ",341
"A Whole Lot of Other Choices in the Area I booked this hotel because the location was going to be very convenient to the event I was attending. I really should have checked Trip Advisor first. This place is bad. Stay away!I am normally a pretty easy-going traveler. Read my other reviews. However, this hotel disappointed in almost every way. The front desk staff was rude and unhelpful. The room was in very poor condition. The door lock looked like a last minute improvisation. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable that I have ever experienced. The grounds of the hotel were in disrepair. The highlights of my stay were that I was only there for one night, and my car was still in the parking lot in the morning.  ",342
"Stay away from this hotel! This is the worst hotel I've stayed ever!A disgrace to the Radisson Hotel Chain, the room was filthy and smelled terrible.I was afraid to let my child walk barefoot on the carpet, spots everywhere, yuck!Same goes for the pool; and cannot comment on the breakfast because I would not eat there for a million dollars.To be sincere, the only good thing there is the front desk manager (Don) who acts very professional and deserves to work at a better place.  ",343
"Worst hotel stay I've ever had We went to Dallas to go to a Cowboys game. I have to say the experience we had while staying in that hotel was beyond horrible. The staff were rude, the room we had was filthy, and the service was terrible. Our bathroom had pubic hairs in the tub, toilet and floor. Our toilet was backed up and even though we asked the front desk to fix it, they ignored our request. When I went to the front desk in the morning to schedule our shuttle to the game, I stood in line and was ignored by the driver. He asked to help people that were standing behind me in spanish if they would like to pay for shuttle service. This went on for a while and I started to feel embarrassed and I didn't know why the driver was doing this, so I asked. He replied that if I wanted to get served there that I would have to learn how to speak Spanish. I was floored! Not only was that a racial remark, but it was so unprofessional. My son was also treated very badly, he is a special needs child. I had knee surgery a few weeks prior to this hotel stay and needed to ice my knees due to swelling so I had my son go downstairs to ask where the ice machine was because every time that I called downstairs to the front desk, they would put me on hold. This went on for over 45 minutes. I could barely walk at that time due to pain and swelling so I had my 12yr old son go find out where the ice machine was at the front desk downstairs. He went down stairs to ask where the ice machine was and the woman at the front desk ignored him. He stood in front of her for more than 15 minutes. Had I not gone down to check on him, who knows how much longer he would have had to wait. When I went down to the front desk, there he stood in front of her. I asked him if he had been helped yet, he said he asked but she told him to wait. When I asked for assistance, the front desk clerk told me the same thing and then continued to goof around with 2 male coworkers and completely ignored us both. I got so upset that I asked to speak with their supervisor. She snapped back and said, they're not here. So I said thank you and started to walk away from the front desk, I heard one of the men behind the counter say, SNAP! And then the front desk clerk stated that I was a dumb [--] and then I heard a bunch of laughing. I don't know what kind of business they are running there, but they really need to do something about the quality of service that they are providing paying customers. I have never been so humiliated in my life. I was racially harrassed, pubically humiliated and I would never stay in that hotel ever again. Out of all of the Radisson hotels that I have ever stayed in, this one has to be the worse overall. I will have you know that before this experience I loved staying at the Radisson and I would actually recommend friends and family to stay with this hotel chain. Not any more. I did call their customer service department to let them know about this experience and they did apologize. We also were sent vouchers for 2 free nights at any Radisson location. Although I may stay at any of the other Radisson locations that I've stayed in and had a better experience, I will never stay at this particular location. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. You'll thank me later.  ",344
"kept the luggage. lost the room We had booked 3 separate rooms, for 2 nights each,with written confirmations.After landing, we picked up our rental car, and stopped atthe hotel to drop off our bags.Our rooms weren't ready, but they gladly stored our bags.We went to our trade show, then to dinner, and got backto the hotel at 9:40pm. They still had our bags, but had givenaway our rooms. They walked us, to another hotel owned by the same company, but 20 minutes further away...andnot as nice.The folks behind the desk continued to check in others, as we werebeing sent away. We were told that the manager only works8-5, and that there was no one in the hotel who could help us.  ",345
"What A Dump This hotel needs an update badly. The pool was kinda green and not very inviting. Electrical outlets in the room were broken. Carpeting in the room looked dirty to the point you didn't want to take your shoes off. Iron didn't work and was replaced with another non-working model. Breakfast in the hotel dining room is an OK self-serve experience (eggs made to order). This was a bargain rate compared to other hotels, but you definately get what you paid for. I wouldn't stay there again.  ",346
"a little rough around the edges We chose the Radisson for our 19th anniversary getaway because the rates seemed reasonable for the accommodations. When we vacation, we don't spend a lot of time in our room but want it to be very neat and clean. We went into this past weekend, based on Tripadvisor reviews, knowing that the Radisson was in the final phases of a major remodel, which is basically what we found. We reserved a room with a sleep number king bed, which my wife tried and enjoyed, and ended up in a suite rather than a regular room which was a nice surprise. There were obvious signs of a remodel in progress; missing baseboards in the hallway and in our room, hallway temperatures on the sixth floor around 95 degrees due to a missing thru-the-wall a/c unit, minor problems w/one of the a/cunits in our room, and an under the-counter-fridge in our room which we defrosted ourselves to get it to work properly. Having been in the construction industry for over 30 years, my guess is that the work that has been done was done in-house rather than by a professional contractor. On the positive side, the front desk and staff were very polite and responsive to our requests for maintenance and very helpful to us in finding our way around town.Would we stay there again knowing what we know now? Sure. At $70 per night for a suite w/a king bed, the Radisson was acceptable though not impressive. We found nothing gross or disgusting but rather a well-trained staff trying to make up for the obvious inconvenience of a remodel in progress. We also found a watch by the pool Sunday that we would really like to return to its rightful owner. My message today left w/housekeeping, who is in charge of lost and found, has not been acknowledged yet.cakesetmoi  ",347
"Dallas Dump Desiring a Dress-Up To put it plain and simple.......this is not one of the greatest hotels in Dallas. In fact, we were pretty disappointed. Being on Northwest Highway, this hotel has great potential. Prime location, close to lots of entertainment and dining options, virtually no competition with any hotels around. However, the Radisson has not yet taken advantage of its opportunities. When we arrived, we were told we would be staying in a pool side suite with a kitchenette and separate living space. Sounds Great, huh!!! Forget it. The room itself was nicely decorated, but the A/C did not work, the room smelt of stagnant cigarette smoke, and the outside looked like a run down trash motel. In fact, they have two areas for rooms. One is within the main building!!! ASK FOR THESE ROOMS. The others rooms are separated to the outdoors like an older motel. Only about 1/4 of these rooms were renovated, so tons of these rooms were trashed out. In fact, this specific area was accessable to anyone who wanted to walk through an unlocked, opened fence. We called the front desk to complain about the A/C. They said someone would be up to fix it. An hour later, and still 90 degrees in the room, we went to the front desk and requested a new room on the inside of the building. They were very polite and quickly found us a new room on the 4th floor. I have no complaints about the staff. They were fine. Upon arrival to the 4th floor, we realized that one of the rooms had apparently sprung a leak. There was standing water in the hallway! NICE!!! We went in our room. It was cold, newly remodeled, and had a comfy bed. Despite the water, we opted to stay. We both slept very well. No complaints there. Basically, this hotel is undergoing major renovation, however, they don't seem to understand that guests don't want to be a forward participant in the dirty side of renovation. In my opinion, if you are thinking about staying here to save $20, just spend the extra $20 on a better hotel. Sorry Radisson, you failed. We will most definately never stay here again!!! HAPPY TRAVELS!!!  ",348
"Nothing Special Good location, avg. hotel but overpriced at 89 a night. The front desk was ok, the toilet hung and the a/c didn't work, after switching us to another room without any problems everything was fine, however I probably wouldn't stay here again.  ",349
"texas hospitality My husband and I stayed here 3- 11-05 to 3-13-05 and had a great time. The hotel is 12 min from downtown. The hotel has a free shuttle service from both DFW airport and Love Field which was really nice so we didnt have to rent a car. The price of the hotel was cheap $52 a night through hotels. The hotel itself is nice and clean. The rooms were decorated nicely. and clean. The hotel staff kept checking to make sure our stay was satisfactory and made themselves available if we needed them.The hotel is right by restaurant row and a movie theatre. The shuttle drivers take you to the restaurant of your choice (Joes crab shack, chilis, red lobster, humperdinks, pappa deux seafood etc...) That was nice. I would recommend tipping the drivers $1 -2 as a courtesy. The shuttle drivers will go out of their way to get you where you want to go, they are friendly and helpful with tourist type questions.I would recommend going to down town and going to the JFK museum at the book depository building in the west end market. It costs about $8 (with coupon from hotel) per person. It was very interesting to see such history, to be there. I am in my early thirties so I wasnt even around during this time, but I can only imagine and to see the footage from that day gave me goose bumps. It was interesting to learn the history behind it all. I some how thought the grassy knoll would have been bigger. Beware of scammers down by there trying to get you to buy a tour, dont do it. Take the day and walk around down town and the market, it was cool. My husband and I walked from the Book Depository building up two blocks to Ross st and then all the way down ross to Aknard (just past the Fairmont hotel) to the M LINE Trolley (which is free) and we rhode the Trolley to the Hard Rock Cafe (on mckinney st) this is the place to be there are nice shops. We also got back on the trolley going down mckinney to the Westend village (this is the place to do shopping it is a very nice area with nice exspensive shops and cute out of the way restaurants ) it is in the Turtle Creek area where a lot of wealthy people live. Very Quaint. We had a great time and the hotel although isnt in downtown, did everything a hotel should do, they took care of us.  ",350
"Enjoyed my stay!!! We had a great time! We went for the OU/Texas game and what a great location. The staff was friendly and the food was great. The place is under new management and the place was fantastic. The new owners have put a lot of money into fixing up the place and will continue their remodeling of all the rooms in the next 6 months. We stayed in one of their suites and it was great. If you're looking for a place close to Dallas/Love Field, this is your place!!  ",351
"Worst place I ever stayed Booked a three night stay here on Expedia. The rates were good and this hotel was conveniently located. First impression was that the lobby was a little run down, then it got worse. The lamp shades on the bedside lamps were broken. The control for the hot/cold water on the tub was falling off and there was no hot water in the tub that evening. The next morning, still no hot water in the tub. Called maintenance. They worked on my bathroom for a while and then I had 1 minute of hot water. That evening I changed rooms. Also had broken lamp shades and no hot water. Changed rooms again. The third night the restaurant had no hot food because there was a gas leak in the kitchen. Also, no hot water. They had to jack-hammer the cement floor to repair the gas line and the entire hotel shook. At midnight I had had enough. I had to pack up and move to another hotel.  ",352

"A Royal Stay At Royal Park The view from our room was just magnificent. There were the usual buildings typical of HK set against a backdrop of green rolling hills (or low mountains?) and a lake. This hotel is located in a sort of mega complex. It's connected to New Town Plaza, an upscale mall (stores and restaurants were mid to high end), which is also connected to the Sha Tin MTR station. So when you get off the station, you walk through the mall to get to the hotel. It's very convenient, you don't even have to step outside. It's 15 mins. away from Tsim Sha Tsui via MTR. The location is perfect if you want to sleep away from the busier TST area but still have easy access to it. There is also a bus stop right outside the hotel where you can catch the airport bus (and others). We got upgraded to the executive floor at no extra charge so I think maybe our room was a little bit better than the typical standard rooms. The room/bathroom was big, bright, beautiful and perfectly clean. The decor/style is modern with a touch of Asian aesthetics, just enough to make it non-generic. It didn't have any unpleasant smell even though it was a smoking room. The bed was soft and comfy. There was a big LCD TV with cable and both wi-fi and broadband internet was available in the room although I don't know if it's free since we didn't bring a laptop. My husband did use the internet in their business center for a fee (I think HKD40 for half an hour). The staff were friendly and helpful and check in/check out was a breeze. We also found a small playground called Snoopy's World in an outdoor area between the hotel and the mall. My son had fun playing there. It was small but it had a cute water ride, a playground and a diner. It's very photo-friendly because it's decorated with Snoopy and cartoony stuff. Compared to other HK hotels, the price is awesome for all the things Royal Park has to offer. No wonder it's rated as one of HK's top hotels on TripAdvisor. It's definitely on top of my personal list. LOVED IT!  ",354
"Great location for shopping The hotel is conviniently located next to the malls and MTR station. There is a MTR line from East Tsim Sai Tsui to Sha Tin MTR. It only take about three minutes to walk, thru the mall, from Sha Tin MTR to the hotel.The room is standard western 5-star hotel, but I thought the breakfast was lack of variety and the food were tasteless. The third floor is connected to the mall where there are lots of food stalls; but they are lack of seating tables. Be prepare to order the food to go and eat them in your room.The location of the lifts and lobby is akward since there is a staircase between them; which makes carrying lots of suitcase and children a bit of a hassle. But, besides that, the hotel is great and I am considering to stay in the hotel in the future.  ",355
"out of city center, but decent i had a difficult time figuring out how to get to this hotel. but that is more an issue with the system at the airport - than the hotel itself. this is a really nice hotel. the concierge desk people were very good. and the rooms are good. during my stay the first two nigths were great. but on the third night, the night before my big presentation the next day - a couple with a screaming baby moved in next door! so i just sucked it up and went to do my presentation. when i returned i politely inquired to the front desk if i could change rooms... but i wanted a comparable room (wouldn't mind an upgrade for the trouble of packing a day early essentially). so front desk said okay. then i was taken to my new room -- smaller and further from elevator! in addition, the new room had two burned out lamps and lacked a bathrobe. i don't usually use the latter, so no big deal, but you get my point that they don't pay attention to details. so i told front desk i was not happy. they just said whatever and offered to give me the original room back! so basically, i was inconvenienced, and when i politely addressed the issue = i was downgraded (at same price). they insisted the smaller room had a better view?!?! so, i guess i would describe them as a 3 star in four star clothing. in a pinch, good place = because new town plaza is attached; so you can pretty much get anything you want from there, and the MTR has a station in the plaza. also, bus A41 goes right to the front of the hotel. and at the time i stayed there is was a HK$21 trip = good value. the other thing, my original room faced the apartment complex and i got free wifi. when i was put in my new romm, poof, no wifi. and the price for getting the internet is HK$100 a day.

"Fantastic- 4-5 star level service, great value This hotel is up to the standards of any four star property in Asia (which is several steps above the equiviliant in the US or Europe). I frequently travel in the region, usually at high-end luxury properties. If there are two things I value most in any hotel, its uniqueness and flexibility. I hate generic chains, and this hotel is anything but. Its pure class, without being generic- little decorative touches make all the difference. The location is not central (although there is a metro only a 10 min indoor - through a mall- walk from your room), but I was here for a conference at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the location was perfect. Took only 25 min door to door, including the university shuttle bus. I stayed on the executive floor, which was definitely worth the relatively small upgrade price. Free breakfast in a private executive room, with at most 2-3 other people was a welcome respite from the chaos of the restaurant downstairs filled with mainlanders. Was also a nice place to wind down in the evening, with snacks that mitigated my need for dinner at all. The food was excellent, the fruit perfectly ripe (often wanna-be luxury hotels will hug the letter, not the spirit of luxury in things like this- providing fruit, but not checking the quality, etc). Fruit in my room. Drinks free from the minibar and available in the executive lounge across the hall all day/night. Free internet included. Great views.This hotel excels in the details. Fabrics are rich and interesting, everything works perfectly, service is thoughtful but not intrusive.Biggest fluffiest pillows I have ever had! Tasteful and unique decor.Only downsides- the airport shuttle, although included in the price of my room, comes infrequently, and they lost my reservation on the way here. Just grab a cab- cheap and quick, especially after a long flight. The hot water was variable from the shower, which had a tendency to go from cool to scalding every 5 min or so, but was manageable once you got used to the tap. Room service food was not very good, but thats to be expected, even in the nicest places in Asia.One of the best values I have seen- US$160 for the executive room, with tax included. Book from the hotel or the website- its much cheaper.  ",357
"Almost Perfect The Royal Park Hotel is a fantastic hotel that aspires to be up there with some of the best in the world, a fantastic entrance with space imposing mirrors marble flooring and golden framed doorways...An eclectic range of restaurants to from the traditional Chinese/Dim-Sum to a more European restaurant which also doubles as the fantastic buffet breakfast facility and a Japanese Teppanyaki eatery.Staff were attentive and welcoming and spoke excellent English, tea coffee at breakfast was always refilled quickly and efficiently and we never had to wait for a table either at Lunch or Dinner in the hotel.Room itself was a tiny bit on the small side to be perfectly honest, this is my only gripe with the hotel and the only point holding it back from a full 5 stars....maybe the room would have been a sufficient/spacious size for two but for three was just the wrong side of comfortable...but only slightly, it really wasn't that much of a worry.Amenties in room were fantastic, with every need almost being catered for from the dressing gowns in the bathroom to the mini-bar and the big LCD TV, beds were also very good too and room was well decorated throughout, with a special mention going to the spacious Shower/Bath/Toilet facility.On paper the hotel seems like it isn't in a fantastic location, but we found it to be near perfect...it's not right in the centre of HK so you don't have the noise pollution, smog etc. to contend with but its not far outside the main central area that you feel you're missing out...with Central station being a mere 10 minute MTR hop away.Another quick mention about the location if you love shopping, you'll love the location as it's practically right on top of a shopping centre!!Great experience throughout here, and would come back again as i found HK and this hotel very nice indeed.

"Very Nice 4 Star Hotel This is a very nice 4+Star Hotel. It is located about a 15-20 minute subway (MRT) ride from downtown Kowloon in the suburbs, which is really nice in terms of getting away from the noise and crowds. The hotel is connected to a few shopping centers with food courts and supermarkets. The subway (MRT) station is a 10 minutes walk thru one of the shopping centers. Hotel also has a shuttle service to downtown area. Ask for a room overlooking the river. There is a very nice walking/jogging area along the river. Rooms very nice and well appointed. Internet available in room, but I found it to be slow. I complained and they took the charge off (cost is by the minute, to US $12 max for 24 hours). Staff tries to be very accomodating. I paid about US $125/night  ",359

"Excellent Hotel We stayed one night in this hotel on a stopover in Hong Kong and we liked it very much. The room (we booked a standard one but I think they gave us an upgrade) was the best we've ever had in a hotel, large, well-equipped and clean. It had a very pleasant river view over the park next door, where scores of people came to do their morning exercises. The staff were very helpful. We didn't use any of the other hotel facilities, but I expect they were good.The only downside is that the area, Sha Tin, is pretty remote - perhaps 10 miles - from the centre of Kowloon on the East coast of the New Territories.. It's not on any of the normal tourist maps. However, it's modern and the park and the river are very pretty. The shopping malls next to the hotel are pretty comprehensive, the MTR and bus stations are very close, and there's an hourly shuttle into Kowloon. The A41 bus from the airport costs around $25, takes about 40 minutes and stops outside the door.We stayed in a hotel on the main island on our return stopover, and although we liked that too, we had fond memories of the peace of Sha Tin.  ",361
"Fine hotel, location far from central Overall, we thought his hotel to be pretty good - the staff were friendly and helpful, our room was fine though not overly spacious - the only issue for us was the hotel's location. It is a long way from what might be called the centre of Hong Kong. In our ignorance we first used taxis to get downtown. They were very expensive, so it's important to check out the alternatives. Others told us that the hotel bus was unreliable and our best journey was by train - the ticket cost 16 Dollars for the 2 of us, compared to 300 for the taxi! There is also a huge new shopping mall immediately next door to the Park Royal which is nice and convenient and that's where the train stops too.Overall, we thought the hotel was better than Hong Kong itself, which - by an large - did not impress us. We summed it up as millions of people crowded into countless high rise apartment blocks that totally over filled the very small land area available. So not great!  ",362
"Fabulous rooms Recently refurbished for the Olympic equestrian teams the rooms are modern, spacious and comfortable with all the amenities you'd expect. We stayed on the Executive Floor with private check in/out and lounge/business facilities where the service was wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast offered a wide selection of international cuisine and the Chinese Restaurant was the best we ate for our entire time in Hong Kong. The Newtown Plaza shopping centre is located next door which is one of the biggest in Hong Kong and also accommodates an MTR station so getting around was easy. I cannot recommend this hotel enough as long as you don't mind staying out of the city.  ",363
"Excellent hotel! We have just returned from a six night stay at the Royal Park Hotel in Shatin, Hong Kong. We booked it following reading reviews on Tripadvisor and were not disappointed. The hotel is 20 minutes outside of Hong Kong itself but travel into Kowloon is easy. There is an excellent shuttle bus from the hotel (free if you book an Executive Room package) and it runs on the hour and returns from Kowloon on the half hour. The train system is also very convenient even if it does involve a little bit of walking and the excellent Octopus Card which you can purchase at the information desk at airport arrivals makes travel a breeze. The hotel is very easy to get to from the airport. Just exit down the ramp in the middle of arrivals and at the bottom, turn right to the bus park (make sure you don't go left to the tour coaches). The card costs 150 HK dollars including 50 dollars for the card (refundable) and100 HK dollars credit. Once you go down the ramp to the exit and turn right look for bus A41, get off at the third stop, the one after the bus terminal in Shatin Mall. The driver doesn't give change so the Octopus card is your best bet and the bus stops right outside the hotel itself. 150 HK dollars covered all our travel including the star ferry, buses and trains and we didn't need to use a taxi other than from the hotel to the airport for our return which cost 320 HK dollars as our flight was early before first airport bus at 5.30am.Anyway, back to the hotel. Even though they say it is their 20th Anniversary you would never know it as it is modern, stylish, immaculately kept and very welcoming. If you can, get an Executive room package as the extra you pay is well worth it. The Executive rooms are normally on the 16th floor,and request one with a river view. All the extras make it great value as access to the Executive Lounge gives free internet access, free breakfast, access throughout the day for soft drinks and free alcoholic drinks and canapes between 6pm and 8pm. It also includes free travel on the shuttle bus and other benefits. The biggest disappointment was the hotel food. Breakfast was quite extensive but of only fair quality and we tried dinner in both the 2+2 restaurant and their Chinese Restaurant, both of which were disappointing. In fairness, when I raised my concern it was dealt with efficiently and promptly. If staying for six nights it is best to look at their extended stay package as it is a great deal even if you check out a day earlier than the package deal. Check their website carefully to see the various packages available. The staff, almost without exception were charming and helpful. We only came across one surly person all week and he was from the Concierge team. The hotel Leisure Centre looked good even though we didn't use it and all in all, we were glad we booked a hotel outside of the cente itself as it was great value for money and allowed us to escape the throbbing life of Kowloon and Hong Kong City.Amongst the many things we enjoyed were a visit to the Peak and a visit to the 10,000 Buddahs Temple in Shatin. The temple is only a 5 -10 minute walk from the hotel but beware the 500 steps you have to climb but it is worth it when you get to the top! Head for Pai Tau Village just next to the Shatin bus teminal outside the Mall and you will see the signposts for the Temple. Another great day or half day trip is to Sai Kung, a charming fishing village just a 45 minute bus ride from the hotel. We took the 299 bus from Shatin to Sai Kung and used our Octopus Cards. There are loads of great seafood restaurants round the harbour in Sai Kung. Our frustration was we had breakfast and arrived at lunchtime and therefore weren't hungry but we couldn't resist a plate of prawns in garlic with a bottle of wine. The buses run till quite late so it is possible to make an evening of it, well worth a try. We also enjoyed going to Aberdeen. Several buses go there but we took the 75 from the main Central Exchange. There is a free ferry transfer to Jumbo, allegedly the world's largest floating restaurant. We had a few beers on board overlooking the marina with some seafood samplers as canapes. This was inexpensive and a good experience. People have criticised the food on Jumbo but for a few picks it was reasonable and fun. We did find it difficult locating good restaurants but that was our fault rather than Hong Kong as people say the food is great. We found a bustling food area on Knutsford Terrace near Jordan Road. where we had a good meal. It is also worth visiting the night marketynear Jordan Road where there are loads of food outlets with many people eating in the open air, we decided to give it a miss however even though it did look authentic. One food experience we didn't do and now regret is having dinner on The Terrace at the Peninsula Hotel. Their buffet dinner is about 拢45 a head but looked stunning. If you are not stayng at the Peninsula or having dinner there, at least go into the lobby for a glass of wine. At 拢12 a glass it is not cheap but the experience transports you back to a bygone age - try it!!Another thing worth doing is to go for a walk in the park next to the hotel at 7.15am in the morning. The early morning warmth is intoxicating as you sit and watch hundreds of people doing exercises to music using fans, swords etc - a charming experience which you wouldn't get if you stayed in the city itself!!It was a long 12 hour trek from London to Hong Kong for six nights but well worth the experience. We travelled on Air New Zealand and the airline was excellent, on time, good planes and very good service and food. Would we go to Hong Kong again and repeat the experience? There is no doubt about it and we would also make the Royal Park our base.  ",364

"Great hotel at great rates! We booked a longstay package via the hotel website, at a great rate. The Royal Park is officially listed as a 3 star hotel, but I think that has to be reviewed: I would say it is a potential 4 to 5 star hotel.Location is outside citycenter. Hongkong has different citycenters and this hotel is conveniently located inside one of the biggest malls in HK. So no loss there as far as shopping is concerned. Downtown HK is very close by using the MTR, it takes app. 10 minutes to get there. The MTR is a very efficient and cheap means of transport as well as the intricate system of busses (doubledecker, green and red busses). Buy an Octopus card for easy travelling on all public transport.The rooms in the Royal Park were very spacious, clean and with a contemporary interior. We didn't use the breakfast or dining facilities as there were enough restaurants in the surrounding area of Sha Tin.A definite find in HK!  ",366
"Wonderful location away from downtown Kowloon Sha Tin is a great location on the edge of the New Territories. The hotel looks out over the Pearl River and it's a short walk to the riverside park. Walking along the river is a wonderful respite from Hong Kong's busy city streets. The room is large and comfortable. Breakfast in the Executive room is spartan, so the buffet restaurant is a better deal, although the selection is still not great. The hotel is located next to two large shopping centres and the MTR. It only takes a 10-15 minutes by train to Kowloon, so if you don't want to stay in the downtown area, this is a good choice.  ",367
"Bad experience when i reach the hotel, i was told to be brought up to 16th floor to check in as i'm staying executive. the receptionist called a guy to bring me up because u need the keycard to use the lift. so then we went into the lift together, he pressed 16 and 9. no idea why, he walked out of the 9th floor to continue his work i think. he did not say anything and left, so i asked, 'is this the floor i suppose to be?' he pointed at the 16th floor and left. i reached the executive floor and got lost. nobody anywhere. i wandered for 10mins to find the hidden lounge for checking in. i stayed for 2 nights, twice during breakfast, nobody greeted me, asked me if i wanted coffee or tea, i can see and hear the executive receptionist and butler talking and laughing non stop because they were right in front of my table. i was the only one having breakfast btw. since nobody seems to bother, i just do watever i want, so after breakfast i used the internet in the exec. lounge, i saw minimised blogs of the butler. cos his pics are everywhere. the mini bar in the room is really deceiving. there're only 2 cans or beer and soft drinks, thats all. being executive package, i get free mini bar consumptions and free topping up. it was not topped up at all. i also remembered when i checked in, i asked if i can use credit card for deposit and pay cash when checking out, they said yes, but when i check out, they said sorry, credit card had already been charged. i wrote in to tell them wat i had gone through but to get an email in a non apologic way saying they are sorry giving such bad experience but such experience doesnt mean overall performances for olyimpic chosen hotel. i will only go again for the price, i stayed twice and non were good in any services.  ",368
"Great hotel and staff We chose to stay in the Executive suite, it was very nice and worth paying the extra money. You have acces to the exec lounge where you can go for breakfast and have snacks and drinks all day. We also spent most nights in the exec lounge having cocktails and food, which was certainly a nice way to finish the day. It is very private and quiet in there and the staff make you feel special. We certainly would reccommend this hotel and pay the extra to have the exec floor because it is all included in the room rate. And the hotel shuttle to down town is included. The only thing which we thought was a bit misleading was the free mini bar, as it only has two cool drinks and two beers in it. But i guess if you can access free drinks all day in the exec loung it didn't matter.The staff were all wonderful and the room was great.Location is a bit away from the city but public transport/shopping centres are so close it does not matter. Being away fron the city was nice as we got a little tired of 'copy watch!!! ect  ",369

"Five shiny stars for Royal Park We had a great stay at the Royal Park. It is so conveniently located right next to a shopping mall and access to the MTR transit system (which is the only way to get around Hong Kong).The Hotel is clean and well kept and all service staff is very helpful and accomodating. The swimming pool area is very pleasant with an indoor/outdoor situation.The only complaints would be that they dont put a top sheet on the beds. Just a bottom sheet and a feather duvet with a sheet like cover that they change every day. Also, the windows dont open, so no outside air, but some people dont care about that so not too big of a deal.We tried to explain the concept of another sheet to the maid who nodded and smiled, but never seemed to get it. Communication breakdown.We were at this hotel for 10 days and would DEFINITELY go back .  ",371
Loved this Hotel in HK I styaed at this hotel in January and this hotel was great excellent services amazing rooms very clean staff was good. The locating is very good a little bit off the main thoroughfare but they provide a shuttle to Kowloon which was a bonus.When I go back to Hong I will stay here again and again. The food was also very good and staffs speak good english. If you are planning to stay here dont hesitate.  ,372
"Great Hotel  I have stayed here for 7 consecutive nights. The price is great since I am on their long stay packing..which costed me NETT HK$5200 (inclusive of all taxes) for corporate rate! The standard room is big and comes with a two seater couch too..very modern design throughout the whole hotel, they have just recently refurnished..so it is FANTASTIC. The location is abit off since I am here for business but the hotel shuttle compensate this all, it takes about 20mins from the hotel to Tsim Sha Tsui MTR, and from there u can take mtr to hong kong island in less than 5mins. there are many great malls around here, if u are here for holidays, shopping here is great, variety of international and local brands, many restaurants just a stone throw away from the hotel, and they all connected to the hotel by overhead covered bridgesThe healthclub is fantastic, I used the gym every night and hardly anyone there.. the pool is big enough, it stretches from indoor to outdoor and of the right temperature.I didn't use the laundry service in the hotel, i went across to Hilton mall laundry shop, that charged HK$30 for 7pounds load of clothes, collection within 3 hours. Its the Wing Shing Dry Cleaning at Shop 2A, level one, hilton plaza (3mins walk from hotel), tel[--](if you need the conceiger to assist you)  ",373
"Gr8 Hotel in Sha Tin We decided to stay at this hotel for just under 2 weeks as a way to see the rest of HK, and for the price it was absolutely great! The hotel is situated in the Northern Territories, and if you plan on staying in HK for more than just a few days, this is an ideal way to see the city, as it has great transport links, which are pretty cheap and efficient. The hotel is situated right next to the huge Sha Tin mall, which has all the usual Western brand names, as well as a wide variety of Western chain restaurants, and some very good Chinese restaurants, all of which are open fairly late.There is currently construction work next to the hotel for a new cinema, but we could not hear any of the noise from the 8th floor, although they had sent us a note saying that the water supply to the rooms will be cut off for a few hours, but this did not really affect us. We did make use of the bar on a number of occassions, and drinks were not too expensive...we did not make use of the restaurants, but the prices seemed much higher than eating in some of the nearby restaurants.As suggested by other reviews, the A41 double decker bus services runs every 15-20 mins between Sha Tin and the airport and only costs 20HKD per person (use exact change), taking 40 mins or so, and this works out much cheaper than using a taxi. We also made regular use of the hourly shuttle service offered by the hotel to Kowloon (which takes 15-20 mins - dropping you off outside the Peninsula hotel) for only 15HKD. If you want to be more flexible try using the very good train service, which is only 3-5 mins walk from the hotel.The park situated behind the river is also very clean and peaceful, and we used it regularly for peaceful walks in the morning and evenings. The heritage museum is also 10 mins walk and is a good way to spend a few hours. We also decided to see the 10,000 Buddhas temple, which again is 10 mins walk, and although it is on a steep hill, there are a number of escalators which take you right to the top for good views of the area.All in all, we would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to have a nice peaceful stay, away from the hustle bustle of central HK, but at the same time see the city in an effective and efficient way.

Excellent Value       Standard Room  ,375
"Excellent Value After our disappointment with the Royal Plaza in Kowloon, we spent our last night in Hong Kong at the Royal Park which is in Sha Tin. Wasn't expecting much for the cheap price we paid, but boy were we wrong. This hotel is top notch! Modern, clean line decor throughout the hotel. Rooms were spacious and linens were soft and quite comfy. Hotel provides an hourly shuttle bus to Tsim Sha Tsui (didn't take it but nice to know it is available) and is connected to a shopping mall with train station connections. Although further away from TST and many of the tourisity attractions, it was nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of Kowloon. Staff are very friendly and helpful.  ",376
"Incredible hotel This has got to rank among the best hotels that I have ever been in. Courteous service, convenient location (next to many shopping malls, the A41 route to/from the airport, and a short walk from a train station), and impeccably clean.I was on the 13th floor and didn't smell a whiff of smoke. The view out my window was quite nice however.The pool looked lovely.The only downside: The HK$100 charge for internet feels like being nickle/dimed, but this kind of thing seems to happen at all nice hotels.The area restaurants also seem to close about 30min - 1 hour ahead of their posted times so be careful if you are really jetlagged.  ",377
"4 star in the Suburbs This is a great hotel to stay at, if you plan to see all of Hong Kong and not just the Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. It is1/2 way to Lo Wu, the border with Shenzhen, China. I stay at this hotel often, as I'm working in Sheung Shui or Shenzhen. It's about a 20minute ride to the border, and 20-30 minute ride to Tsim Sha Tsui; which can be quite tiring if you plan to spend evenings downtown. I'd rank this as a 4 star hotel on the US/Euro scale of hotels. The rooms are large, and the staff is very friendly. As with most hotels in HK there is a mall next door - which is where the KCR train station is as well; about a 5 minute walk through the mall. The rooms are nicer and cheaper then all the hotels I've stayed in in Kowloon.  ",378
"Great Value, Convenient and Easy Access to City       Shopping Center Next To Hotel  ",379
"Great Hotel Amazing hotel in an amazing city!Sha Tin is a perfect location as it puts you away from the crowds and noise of city centre but at the same time you can be there in 10 minutes thanks to the KCR. Bus from the airport stops right in front of the door, and the hotel is connected with 4 shopping centres!Hotel itself is a steal at that price, rooms are clean although you would have to upgrade to have a nice view (which we havent done)Service was great and facilities as well.The only thing: do not eat breakfast there: you will be ripped off blind for the stuff you eat - you can get something in the mall across the street for few times cheaper!I would love to go back to Hong Kong and if I do I will be booking with Royal Park once again!

A Fantastic Find in Hong Kong       Royal Plaza shopping mall  ,381
"Nice, Convenient hotel- Superb staff Thank goodness for trip advisor. First, we arrived at the HK airport. Following the advice of other travelers, we did a few things. First, we exchanged our money at the ATM and saved. Then, we took the A41 shuttle bus to the Royal Park ($20 HKDpp) and saved. It is true; A41 drops you directly in front of the hotel. We paid about $125 USD per night for a superior room on the 13th floor (the only non-smoking floor) . The rooms were a nice size, with lush king bed (so comfy), heavenly pillows, an average sized bathroom with tub/shower, a work desk, and a chaise nestled in the corner. The internet was not free, $100 HKD a day. Calls to china were $50 HKD with additional charges per minute.The staff was the best: helpful, attentive, courteous, professional, did I say helpful. We asked them how to get everywhere and they showed us detail by detail. The conceirge is excellent with good English.The hotel which is conveniently attached to a huge mall with several American stores: BCBG, Calvin Klein, Lacoste, French Connection, Armani Xchange, etc. Also, it is attached to the train stations: KCR, MTR, and other local trains. The railway system is excellent and easy to follow.  ",382

"Modern hotel close to metro station Location-wise I think this hotel is very conveniently located with a metro station just a few steps away. The Sagrada Familia is totally within walking distance (about 15 mins); alternatively it is only one station away if you take the metro. Also, it is a 10-minute taxi ride from Nord bus station which is where you take airport coaches to and from Girona Airport (the Ryan Air airport). The downside is that it is at an intersection of two busy roads so you might have to bear with the noise of the buzzling traffic. The room was fairly modern, but the desks looked pretty dusty (might have something to do with the hotel being situated at the intersection of main roads), and water kept leaking from underneath the sink in our room whenever I turn on the tap. There is also no kettle in the room and it took ages for the hotel staff to bring us hot water. There was free wi-fi in the room but the connection was pretty unstable. If you really need to use the internet, the hotel has a computer down at the lobby.There is obviously room for improvement to keep up to its 4 star rating but service aside if all you need is a modern hotel with a good location, then this is a hotel I would recommend.  ",401
"wonderful rooms we stayed at this hotel for 4 days and it was a very pleasand stay.The hotel is in a great location and the building is new with an excellent inside design.The room was big with a lot of space and modern decoration inspired from the major tourist attractions and it was also very well cleaned every day.Breakfast was ok,stuff was helpful and friendly especially the reception.I certainly recoment this hotel.  ",402
"Not a 4 star hotel by UK standards A contemporary hotel in a good location (Monumental metro literally a 100 yards away), Sagrada Familia 10 minutes walk away. We spent 3 days exploring this great city and didn't spend a great deal of time at the hotel. I have to say that it's not safe to assume that a 4-star hotel will have similar facilities to a typical 4-star hotel in the UK. There were a number of negatives about the hotel that didn't ruin our break, but certainly compelled me to inform others who thinking of booking a stay here.Negatives:* Lack of hotel facilities - an excuse for a bar in the reception area.* Single beds pushed together to make a double - apparently only 4 rooms in the hotel have double beds, make sure you double check if you are getting a double bed in advance* Beds are the firmest I've ever slept on - fine if you like them that way but very hard.* First time I've ever come across this in any hotel but twice around midnight, we came back to the hotel only to find a sign in the window stating 'back in 5 minutes' and the doors locked! We never felt unsafe in the area but a single female traveller might not take too kindly to having to hang around outside the hotel at that hour....* One single toiletry item - shower gel, typical theme in the hotel, a feeling of a lack of facilities.* The biggest issue for me was the fact that the hotel only offer an ironing service and do not provide an iron and iron board to the room. This took us by surprise and if we'd had all the clothes ironed we brought with us, it would have cost over 100 Euros. Perhaps this is a typical policy in Spanish hotels (I've had a similar thing in Athens) but it's a warning for those on a longer break that there is a risk of significant additional costs.* Staff were miserable and we felt like an inconvenience to them at times. A complaint about the twin beds was met with a shake of the shoulders and upon checking out, the receptionist didn't ask if we'd had a nice stay or even said thank you or goodbye - not a big issue, but evidence of a lack of good management and customer care.There is no way this is a 4 star hotel, yes the rooms are nicely furnished, but the sheer lack of facilities made it a three star at best with a BB feel.I would rarely stay at the same hotel twice as it is, but there is absolutely no way I would stay at this place again. I'm sure there are much better bases from which to explore this wonderful city from.  ",403
"Eurostar Gaudi Dec. 2007 We stayed here for three nights beginning Dec.2nd. following a nine day cruise. We took a taxi that had room for four and cruise luggage. The taxis charge by the piece and for a larger minivan. We paid about 30 Euros with tip. While checking in, a member of our party had two carryons stolen by thieves in the lobby at around 9am in the morning. The girl at the desk let two men in the lobby while we were checking in. These men were not guests of the hotel and casually walked in, hung around the area and casually walked out with the carryon luggage before our friend knew what happened. I was involved with checking in and providing passports along with my friend. His wife went to the bathroom and our other friends were looking at the lobby internet and reading maps so stay vigilant even in the small lobby of a small hotel. The rooms were clean and modern and we had a good view of the circle and the towers of Segrada Familia a few blocks away. There is shower gel, soap, but no shampoo. They have fancy showers but only half partition of glass so flooding is common. The drainage is very slow. The towels smell like vinegar. The flat screen worked but not too many offerings in English. There are no good places to eat around the hotel. We don't like the cafe bars. The food is horrible and expensive. The good restaurants are down toward the Port and La Ramblas. The restaurants and cafes are smoke filled so those allergic, don't go to Barcelona. It seems like most people smoke. We saw many young teenagers smoking like chimneys. We used a two day hop on hop off bus at $23 Euros per person and caught it at the Segrada Familia. The metro was really close by the hotel- Monument station was less than a block away, 1.5 Euros each way. The Segrada Familia station was near the tourist site about 4 blocks away. Food is expensive, look for menu of the day offerings for value. Our US dollars don't go far in Europe.We enjoyed the Gothic Quarter and Park Guell. We visited some of the other stops and shopped in local districts on the tour bus route. We noticed that the general population and the non-tourist trade shop keepers have different hours from Americans. We get the impression that they don't work many hours a day. There is plenty to see and it will take more than three days to see many of the main sites. We paid 40 Euros for a taxi to the airport for 4 with 8 pieces of luggage. Other than the robbery, our friends enjoyed the Egyptian museum and Picasso Museum. It was an experience-good and bad.  ",404
"Nice and clean, minor issues This shouldn't be taken for the Gaudi Hotel from La Rambla (which I don't know, just that they are different). Eurostars' Gaudi is 10 minutes walk from Sagrada. If you're lucky you'll view it's roof from the hotel's window. Sagrada is close, but this is not downtown nor the gothic quarter (which is a little bit dirty imo). This is not a central hotel, but it's a quiet neigborhood (for a city).If you want the best of this hotel, ask for one of the rooms with terrace (last floor). They should be much nicer than the rest and bigger (especially if you've seen their website). We stayed in the smallest room, the one near elevators. Those are smaller than the regular ones, but we were OK, it was just a weekend trip.However, if you stay longer, get away from the elevators. The doors are indeed paper sheet, you will be woke up by your neighbors, not by the clock or sun ;) Didn't hear much of the noise on the street, but heard every foot step on the hallway.The hotel is 1 min from the subway station. Very very handy. One issue I noticed is that you will have to switch trains at least once from here, no matter where you head to. Didn't bother me a lot, but worths mentioning.Hotel is clean, furniture was new. A little bit cheap, trying to imitate expensive furniture. It is not... Anyway, better to imitate nice furniture than to have expensive ugly furniture.Didn't have anything to ask to staff so I can't comment. TV stations are not working well, but who needs that in Barcelona? Breakfast is enjoyable here (would be nicer with a view, but the hotel is very small) and there are so many things to do out there. Tip: Definitely go to Barceloneta if you like seafood. Choose any of the 100 fish restaurants there.  ",405
"Good hotel, good location The hotel was new and clean. The room was large and had all the mod cons for a 4 start hotel. The staff was helpful and assisted where possible with my friend who was ill. Free internet. The location was also good - 5 minutes from the Sagrada Familia and about a 15-20min minute walk to the Placa Catalunya or else you can get the bus (5mins  1.25euros) or a taxi for about 4euros. The only downside is that there isn't alot of eateries around the hotel. Definitely recommend this hotel.  ",406
"Romantic Weekend Spoiled Overall a hotel with very nice rooms. However, not acceptable as a 4 star hotel (this is what you pay at the end of the day)Rooms- very nice and clean- TV was not working- Minibar was not refilled- soap, shower gel and body lotion was not refilled. Again, if one goes into a 4 star hotel one should not have to buy hygienic accessories in the supermarket next doorBreakfast: - unfortunately only 2 kinds of sausages, 2 different cheeses- no eggs- no coffee and no tee at 10:30 a.m (although we were told, breakfast is until 11 a.m.) This was clearly not acceptable for a 4 Star hotel. Also, we paid 12 euro per person for this meal.Service- we have complained but were not given any feedback- some reception staff (not all !!) were really rudeAgain, very nice rooms (size, look etc.) but everything else in our opinion is not even 3 star, i.e. you don't get what you pay for.

"Nice clean hotel We stayed at this hotel in September 2006 and really enjoyed it. We had a great view of the Sagrada Familia from our bedroom window. The room was large, clean and modern with very effective air conditioning. There is a metro stop right next to the hotel which makes it very easy to get around. Alternatively, a taxi from the main tourist areas at night is inexpensive and easy to get. It is a modern clean hotel and while it is not right in the centre of the tourist area, it is easily accessible.  ",408
Lovely Hotel Seven of us stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in August. It is a small but lovely boutique hotel which is very modern and clean and the staff are so helpful and pleasant. It is close to the metro station which allows travel around Barcelona and its attractions although the hotel is in walking distance of the Sagrad Familia (which can be seen from the hotel) the beach and the marina. On the last day we were not due to leave Barcelona until 1800 hrs and were able to pay 30 euros to keep a room on until 1700 hrs and were provided with clean towels for everyone. Would definitely use this hotel again.  ,409
Very impressed! This was a lovely hotel - room was lovely and clean and had good soundproofing considering its on the corner of some busy roads!! Its not far from Sagrada Famailia and we could see it from our room. The bathroom was lovely with an amazing power shower. I can not fault this hotel at all. We didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that although maybe a little expensive at 12 euros! Its also very close to the Metro although we didn't use it. We did walk from La Ramblas and it took about 20 minutes. On the other hand we didn't particularly like Barcelona it was very expensive and also way too crowded but i guess the time of year didn't help. If you like busy busy busy and queuing then this is the place for you! We were so glad we chose this great hotel to come back too at the end of the day!  ,410
"Fantastic Hotel A truly excellent hotel experience. Within walking distance of Sagrada Familia, right next to the Monumental Metro station. Room was clean, not big, but very classy with a wall-mounted plasma TV and mural featuring one of Gaudi's buildings. The shower had multiple spray jets and a full marble bathroom. There is free internet in the lobby. Staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful with directions, mailing postcards, etc. Room was quiet and had a great view of the Gran Via and Cathedral. Definitely a great choice for a stay in Barcelona.  ",411

"Great Hotel My wife and I wanted a quiet hotel that was modern and clean, and this hotel was just perfect. Everything looked very designer and new, the rooms were not massive but the bathroom was every thing you could wish for all marble and stylish.We booked with breakfast which I would recommend as they had a wide choice of buffet style food, from rolls,cold meats, to bacon, egg and sausage! The staff were all very helpful too, so full marks.The hotel is only a short walk from the Sagrada Familia Cathedral, and right next to Monumental Metro station on line2, just 2 stops from the central Placa de Catalunya. Buy a 10 trips ticket at the easy to use automatic machines and wonder at how cheap it is to travel there.By the way , we found the Airport Bus from directly outside the arrivals hall to be fantastic value! just 3euros75 each to the center of town which takes 20mins and runs every 10mins!! Why can't we do this kind of service in England at an affordable price?We enjoyed Barcelona and the Hotel was great.  ",415

"Great location, facilities and room In terms of quality against price this is an excellent hotel. I paid Euro 90 for a Sunday night and Euro 130 for a Monday and got great value out of it.First the location: 1 min to underground station, and just 4 stops or 15 - 20 mins to the Barcelona Cathedral. Also walking distance to Sagrada Familia.It got all the (mainly communication) facilities I need - free wireless internet with smooth connection, a safe that accommodates the laptop, and a flat TV. The room is comfy in earth tone and clean modern layout. Reception warm and helpful. The Eurostars Gaudi is up to standard with hotels in major cities in Europe and the States I statyed at when I was travelling on business that costed Euro 250 - 300. If there are any faults at all it might be the hardwood floor in the room which mean you need to move about carefully to avoiding making huge noises, you might also hear foot steps from floor above you. And the door isn't very sound-proof so you hear people talking on the corridor and if they bang their doors you get it loud and clear. But neither points bother me for I am a sound sleeper.  ",419
"Very clean and quiet. If you are looking for a peaceful and safe area of Barcelona to stay in, this is the hotel for you. The rooms were great and we even had a view of the Sagrada Familia. I agree--skip the breakfast. Otherwise, this hotel is a great choice for your stay.  ",420
"Would love to go back Have literally come back today from staying at this hotel, spent 5 days Monday to Saturday  I can honestly say that I cannot fault the hotel, yes it may be a little out of the centre but you can use the metro, 30 seconds walk away to the stop, Line 2 Monumental. We soon got the hang of the lines  thought it was brillant value to buy the T10 ticket which gives you 10 rides, as long as you dont go above ground then its 1 trip no matter how many times you change! I dont think that 5 days was enough, would go back tomorrow! word of warning, be very careful about buying drinks from restaurants along the rambles, we bought a pizza  an omlette that came to 13 euros but our 2 drinks came to another 25 on their own, the prices for them were not displayed which was annoying as we paid 4 euros for a bottle of wine at a chinese restaurant next to the hotel  13 for 1/2 of 1 there!!
