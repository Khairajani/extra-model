## [18-05-21] Simplifying install of `extra-model`

We have updated/removed all the dependencies that don't have wheels. 
In addition, we've switched to Python 3.8 as a base image (we are still testing `extra-model` in 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9).

Full list of changes is available in the CHANGELOG

## [17-03-21] Blog Setup!

`extra-model` v0.2.0 is released!
