There are two examples that come with this repo:

1. [The most basic example](https://wayfair-incubator.github.io/extra-model/site/examples/code/basic_output_for_extra-model.html) with only 7 fake reviews that demonstrate what `extra-model` is all about.
1. [More realistic example](https://wayfair-incubator.github.io/extra-model/site/examples/code/restaurant_report_example.html) where we've used 1000 reviews about different restaurants from an open dataset from Yelp.
