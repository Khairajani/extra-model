# Publish a Release

## Update Package Version

1. Create a version bump feature branch

        git checkout -b bump_version_v1.2.3

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` in the project root

1. Update any documentation that mentions the package version

1. Commit the changes to your local repository

        git add .
        git commit -m 'some brief description of the changes'

1. This library uses the package `bump2version` to automate its versioning, [source](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version).

For example, with the current configuration (in the `setup.cfg` file), running the command 
```bash
bumpversion major|minor|patch
```
will:
* Increase the model major|minor|patch version in the file `extra_model/__init__.py`
* Increase the model major|minor|patch version in the test file `tests/test_init.py`
* Create a commit with the modified files and message `Bump version: {old_version} â†’ {new_version}`
* Tag the last commit as `v{new_version}`

In order to perform a dry run for the command above, execute:
```bash
bumpversion major|minor|patch -n --verbose
```

Please notice that the git working directory is expected to be clean when running `bumpversion`.

Choose the major|minor|patch argument according to the importance of the changes. 
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

1. After successfully running `bumpversion`, please run `git push && git push --tags` to synchronize the local repository with the remote one.

1. Create a PR. Upon approval of the PR, merge changes to the `main` branch with the Github.com UI

1. Pull down the changes merged to the `main` branch

        git checkout main; git pull
