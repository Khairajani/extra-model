# Documentation

* Documentation is written in markdown format and files are kept in the `/docs` directory in the project root.
* API documentation is auto-generated by the `mkdocstrings` package. An example of this can be seen in the `reference.md` file.
* New files must be added to the table of context in `/mkdocs.yml`.

## Develop
