31112048,Nice style but top laminate piece scratches easily.
31022820,Received badly cracked pieces three times before I gave up. Be aware that the table has no finishing on it at all. It’s a raw piece. The three I got had cracks and scratches in multiple places with splinters coming out. Shame because the table by itself i

22830790,I really like it. It is sturdy and the right size. Loved the color. I got the yellow. It was a softer yellow and not garish. I got it for a bedroom I was redoing but it matched the yellow in another bedroom so well that I now have to buy another one.
25854589,The size of the table was really small.  The pictures online make it appear bigger so pay attention to the actual specs.  The table top is not much bigger than a magazine (see my pic).  This is a C table but it is too short to turn above my sofa arm so it

25049835,Very nice looking table & looks more expensive than the price BUT there were no holes pre-drilled to attach the bottom shelf - I do not own a drill so wound up gluing it.

31028241,Easy assembly and makes a great end table set for the cost. Very functional.
28626882,These end tables are nice but smaller than expected. As we have a small living room I was okay with them. They wipe clean easily very little water marks or stains left on any surfaces.. we have a very 'lived in” home. We have 2 large dogs who tend to romp
32977803,I have had these tables for over a year and sadly the quality is lacking. It looks as pictured however the finish scratches easily and the table is super wobbly. We constantly have to tighten the screws to prevent the table from wobbling. They were a good

27595956,"Very cute! But a lot smaller then the photo makes it look. I should have read the dimensions closer - the table top, wood part, is not much bigger then a stretch out hand. Could still hold a coffee cup and book, but that’s about it. I still love the look "
